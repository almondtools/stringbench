lest thou also be tempted:1
that he went through the corn fields:2
Therefore they say unto God:1
and spoiled even all that was in the house:1
Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD:1
great things doeth he:1
that thou hast smitten me these three times:1
and doth not spare:1
for they know his voice:1
and asked:15
And he asked him:1
Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied:1
O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked:1
And the man of thine:1
but his lies shall not be so:1
but God that giveth the increase:1
and he was seen upon the wings of the wind:1
in imprisonments:1
and lieth toward the south west and north west:1
In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel:1
and my words which I have put in thy mouth:1
For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light:1
even the day of the LORD is near:1
Blessings are upon the head of the just:1
If ye be true men:1
and he sent forth his armies:1
And Joses:1
neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate:1
Then came the daughters of Zelophehad:1
about fifteen thousand men:1
in the days of Jael:1
Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant:1
for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him:1
Great is the LORD:2
and also furbished:1
because of the new wine:1
Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines:1
if any bowels and mercies:1
and hold such in reputation:1
And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before the LORD:1
as ye tempted him in Massah:1
in trouble have they visited thee:1
and bless thy people Israel:1
he told him not:3
because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee:1
and Zilthai:2
and of women:1
and returned into the camp:1
to know what Israel ought to do:1
for he shall pluck my feet out of the net:1
and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you:1
one young bullock:5
Two women shall be grinding together:1
who art thou that judgest another:1
and set all the city on an uproar:1
Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon:1
that man shall bear his sin:1
O Tyre:1
Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision:1
verily righteousness should have been by the law:1
stand on the sea of glass:1
Hast thou with him spread out the sky:1
he that ruleth:2
Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets:1
Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned:1
and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground:1
and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ:1
Have I been a wilderness unto Israel:1
when their hearts were merry:1
ye are idle:1
This is a true saying:1
Sheth:7
And the Philistines followed hard after Saul:1
for by their occupation they were tentmakers:1
but speak the word only:1
And Adoram was over the tribute:1
And they took their bones:1
and his concubine:5
He hath an unclean spirit:1
and we in him:1
their stock shall not take root in the earth:1
The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the Grecians:1
and he that is born in his house:1
scatter thou the people that delight in war:1
and had brought them to Babylon:1
and the princes of Judah:1
and set them in their own land:1
This man was instructed in the way of the Lord:1
Zaccur:8
for what sawest thou:1
neither shadow of turning:1
because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with Judah:1
I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel:2
And Elon:2
And for the east side eastward fifty cubits:1
and all the Egyptians:1
and Sarah his wife:2
Not rendering evil for evil:1
LORD God of Israel:98
and he shall bring it to pass:1
they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment:1
Bezaleel:9
and drink offerings:2
all that could skill of instruments of musick:1
Now the God of peace be with you all:1
Kerioth is taken:1
and covered with their wings over the mercy seat:1
I will give Pharaohhophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies:1
And the LORD appointed a set time:1
And Abishai:3
Then went the devils out of the man:1
from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall:1
Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad:1
even I Paul:1
that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace:1
he being girded with a new sword:1
Why withdrawest thou thy hand:1
and guide thine heart in the way:1
And whosoever of you will be the chiefest:1
And the LORD spake unto me:1
and Lahad:1
For this ye know:1
Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants:1
And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites:1
Then thou shalt take an aul:1
Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people:1
I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people:2
for we have seen the land:1
snow:24
Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt:1
and their cords:4
and as soon as the sun was down:1
and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee:1
There they cry:1
And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates:1
and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field:1
O thou backsliding daughter:1
Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity:1
but be thou in the fear of the LORD all the day long:1
they sacrifice to devils:1
Get thee behind me:3
and the asses feeding beside them:1
know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body:1
and goeth up to Japhia:1
and opened every man his sack:1
and Haahashtari:1
And he did so:3
and he took the city:1
And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so:1
it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven:1
to cut off from you man and woman:1
Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt:1
And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem:1
and I will pay thee all:2
then shall they not go out of the holy place into the utter court:1
And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face:1
Even so ye:2
when ye go:4
A sword is upon the liars:1
and wash thy feet:1
O Lord our God:1
and told the Jews that it was Jesus:1
and love with faith:1
for evil is determined against our master:1
a wild ass alone by himself:1
s servant hitherto:1
How then comfort ye me in vain:1
and vessels of brass:3
In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel:1
except they be sent:1
they are come even unto Jazer:1
and devise a device against you:1
and hid snares for my feet:1
to do to him as he hath done to us:1
four hundred cubits:1
and the wombs that never bare:1
Moreover the word of the LORD came to me:2
and was chief:1
on the one side and on the other of the holy oblation:1
yet thy latter end should greatly increase:1
and hid:32
he shall build my city:1
whom ye see and know:1
And Moses turned:1
Send the lad with me:1
All the kingdoms of the earth hath the LORD God of heaven given me:1
I will send my beloved son:1
continue in them:1
nuts:2
and so Barnabas took Mark:1
As it were the company of two armies:1
Judah:721
to profane himself:1
and the LORD shall be with the good:1
And in cutting of stones:1
even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people:1
and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering:1
and turn again and rend you:1
and that thou mayest cleave unto him:1
and ye shall do no servile work therein:1
and thou shalt also prevail:1
When I cry unto thee:1
For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea:1
and there they bruised the teats of their virginity:1
Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind:1
So Abraham returned unto his young men:1
under the hand of Hananiah:1
the heron after her kind:2
And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years:1
For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus:1
and to let the oppressed go free:1
and cleave to his wife:1
and she shall turn to her hire:1
wherewith thou smotest the river:1
and sanctified it:3
and destroyed you in Seir:1
with their three gates:1
and all their earrings which were in their ears:1
that the iniquity of Eli:1
thine eye shall have no pity upon them:1
Then thou shalt say unto them:1
Behold their sitting down:1
And he charged them straitly that no man should know it:1
and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites:1
heard of all that God had done for Moses:1
and the land was desolate:1
the first row shall be a sardius:1
and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind:1
this dreamer cometh:1
and they should seek the law at his mouth:1
to lie in wait:4
Even the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field:1
fire:540
and took thee in:1
and pitched his tent toward Sodom:1
for they had not put him into prison:1
When thou hast eaten and art full:1
the children of Barzillai:2
two men stood by them in shining garments:1
and stand in the gap before me for the land:1
The LORD is righteous in all his ways:1
which they shall make toward this place:1
And the LORD met Balaam:1
and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth:1
for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full:1
And he sat down:2
Wherefore doth a living man complain:1
I knew it that day:1
The tabernacles of Edom:1
tarry:41
so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah:1
and by the pestilence:9
and the waves beat into the ship:1
Are they ministers of Christ:1
thou shouldest see the glory of God:1
and laid their hand on their mouth:1
Then said Elijah unto the people:1
but forasmuch as he defiled his father:1
That Moses commanded the Levites:1
as he that setteth snares:1
And it came to pass at the seventh time:2
unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:1
Without understanding:1
and will plant them:2
but of the living:2
yet I loved Jacob:1
he walketh through dry places:2
For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt:1
and for the porch of the house:1
to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book:1
And Obed begat Jesse:1
When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine increase the third year:1
and they shall come up out of the land:1
thou art near in their mouth:1
and Bethhoglah:1
and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem:1
and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans:1
when thy king is the son of nobles:1
But his citizens hated him:1
When the centurion heard that:1
and he spake as a dragon:1
the field give I thee:1
thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father:1
It is also written in your law:1
how long will ye love vanity:1
and the name of the other Zillah:1
do no more:4
violence and spoil is heard in her:1
And let it be:2
and to loose the seven seals thereof:1
Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant:1
and the oil:9
in the first day of the fifth month:1
we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan:1
Terrors shall make him afraid on every side:1
And he saith unto him:4
and drink their water with astonishment:1
And if thou deal thus with me:1
and not on the sabbath day:1
unto Harosheth of the Gentiles:1
so also the soul of the son is mine:1
all ye workers of iniquity:2
and the great waters were stayed:1
and all the Israelites were troubled:1
destructions are come to a perpetual end:1
seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith:1
could answer a word:1
Thou art my beloved Son:2
and from the multitude of mountains:1
And she sat over against him:1
He hath given meat unto them that fear him:1
or what is the place of my rest:1
and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of:1
He that hath ears to hear:4
if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God:1
and Uri begat Bezaleel:1
in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom:1
and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea:1
when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit:1
For my soul is full of troubles:1
Behold that which I have seen:1
Ye are witnesses:3
And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel:1
and cords:1
but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly:1
and put on him a scarlet robe:1
as they encamp:1
In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod:1
that ye may grow thereby:1
and they fell by the hand of David:1
And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon:1
even of the tribe of Issachar:1
unto the king of Egypt:1
neither is there iniquity in me:1
and playedst the harlot thereupon:1
for thus saith the king of Assyria:1
shall doubtless come again with rejoicing:1
even by the way that he had not gone with his feet:1
even a thousand bullocks:1
and take the goods to thyself:1
and the chief fathers of the congregation:1
And the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem:1
The LORD shall reign for ever:2
and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face:1
which was one reed broad:2
turn aside:19
Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom:1
that their houses shall continue for ever:1
Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it:1
Whosoever shall swear by the temple:1
And who is sufficient for these things:1
Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth:1
thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt:1
to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation:1
With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister:1
let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined:1
the fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands:1
and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding:1
Great is my boldness of speech toward you:1
but attained not to the first three:1
of eighteen cubits high apiece:1
Thou hast forsaken me:1
but the harvest shall be a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow:1
And the Amorites:3
in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us:1
for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai:1
And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo:1
a feast and a good day:1
so they pitched by their standards:1
Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants:1
and the excellency of our God:1
and rest a while:1
that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people:1
that biteth the horse heels:1
we will worship at his footstool:1
No servant can serve two masters:1
Even so will I break this people and this city:1
and all Solomon:1
Their land brought forth frogs in abundance:1
But she was plucked up in fury:1
and took two of his young men with him:1
to walk in God:1
and half followed Omri:1
and he shall burn them:1
but he found her not:1
One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity:1
and bring all things to your remembrance:1
and his oxen:1
Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD:1
and do this:1
and Lot his brother:1
and destroyed out of her the great voice:1
If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed:1
Their webs shall not become garments:1
And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah:1
not fearing the wrath of the king:1
and that will by no means clear the guilty:1
and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD:1
s countenance was changed:2
yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered:1
or deaf:2
and came and fell at his feet:1
The simple inherit folly:1
because thou:59
Say unto them:6
and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard:1
at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils:1
And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning:1
My beloved is like a roe or a young hart:1
which the LORD commanded to make:1
while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted:1
ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof:1
And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes:1
thou Christ:1
mine arm also shall strengthen him:1
whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon:1
And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran:1
Seek ye the LORD while he may be found:1
and departed from the temple:1
and in the streets thereof:1
He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries:1
We trust in the LORD our God:1
even blood shall pursue thee:1
but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city:1
I will call unto the LORD:1
and I will build him a sure house:1
so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink:1
for thou shalt find it after many days:1
Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed:1
Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest:1
that his fierce wrath may turn away from us:1
and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me:2
so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth:1
like unto the feast that is in Judah:1
But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day:1
he is in your hand:1
even the dung of your solemn feasts:1
but The valley of slaughter:1
Of Ozni:1
and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD:1
And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub:1
Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you:1
until we were come over the brook Zered:1
But I speak this by permission:1
that triest the righteous:1
And the LORD was with Joseph:1
and grace for grace:1
and their floods:1
Set bounds about the mount:1
The light shall be dark in his tabernacle:1
and after he hath scraped the house:1
to keep the passover:5
Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people:1
And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee:1
and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem:1
for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth:1
or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us:1
After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired the other piece:1
And king Herod heard of him:1
and made priests of the lowest of the people:1
Oshea the son of Nun:2
but now are ye light in the Lord:1
and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong:1
Shew me thy ways:1
even unto his habitation shall ye seek:1
and Israel would none of me:1
the thrones of the house of David:1
Surely as I have thought:1
and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea:1
And shed innocent blood:1
and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear:1
my belly trembled:1
and unto GOD the Lord belong the issues from death:1
They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with hunger:1
that he began to build the house of the LORD:1
And none considereth in his heart:1
The king of Babylon shall not come against you:1
Gathrimmon with her suburbs:3
praying unto the LORD:1
But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes:1
they shall seem like torches:1
In thee have they set light by father and mother:1
to go unto the country of Gilead:1
even out of Egypt:1
And the angel came in unto her:1
and he sent messengers unto Asher:1
and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away:1
what canst thou know:1
And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward:1
And he made staves of shittim wood:1
when men shall hate you:1
He was more honourable than the thirty:1
Pass ye unto Calneh:1
their hooks were of gold:1
when he shall let you go:1
over against the table:2
and great hailstones in my fury to consume it:1
and thou shalt gather it to thee:1
Upon an instrument of ten strings:1
The asses which thou wentest to seek are found:1
they were about two thousand:1
the God of heaven:19
And he put five bases on the right side of the house:1
and into his oath:1
envying one another:1
These things saith the Son of God:1
And he sent the letters unto all the Jews:1
custom to whom custom:1
Moab also shall wallow in his vomit:1
It is reported among the heathen:1
And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them:1
Salute the beloved Persis:1
it is raised a spiritual body:1
And the man Elkanah:1
and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst:1
We roar all like bears:1
because thou art an austere man:1
so we dwell at Jerusalem:1
O god:2
and drink the wine of violence:1
For all the gods of the nations are idols:1
to fight against me:1
and one taken for Ithamar:1
Pharaoh king of Egypt:20
which was the son of Ragau:1
And hath taken of the king:1
that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us:1
when they came out of Egypt:1
Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest:1
even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver:1
and on our children:1
all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon:1
Be ye mindful always of his covenant:1
and break my covenant:2
and the cruel venom of asps:1
which were made rich by her:1
and a brother is born for adversity:1
Desire not the night:1
Abraham:249
unto the land of Canaan:3
and waited:2
and hath called all the sons of the king:1
that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom:1
to thrust them out of their possession:1
This is the west side:1
Go on before me:1
but they have sought out many inventions:1
And see the land:1
for the children of Israel have sworn:1
and how thou canst not bear them which are evil:1
Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead:1
The word that I have heard is good:1
And the second row shall be an emerald:1
so shall he go:1
For thou didst it secretly:1
Submit yourselves therefore to God:1
where they had not much earth:1
only let us be called by thy name:1
So I opened my mouth:1
the Father hath not left me alone:1
Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king:1
Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity:1
There shall be no more praise of Moab:1
to turn away his wrath:1
and out of the house of the king:1
and all the region round about Jordan:1
and upon the palm trees:1
Daniel spake and said:1
God will not cast away a perfect man:1
Fear ye not therefore:1
And he said to the woman:1
give diligence to make your calling and election sure:1
and laid incense thereon:1
were forty and six thousand and five hundred:2
Suffer it to be so now:1
which dwell alone:1
and said to Judah and to Jerusalem:1
and gather the elders of Israel together:1
and took his two wives:1
For I have heard the slander of many:1
Then the tribe of Naphtali:1
that ye may live:5
Now therefore hold him not guiltless:1
while Mordecai sat in the king:1
The instruments also of the churl are evil:1
and lay on the earth:1
he shall not live:1
As a fountain casteth out her waters:1
until he have finished the thing this day:1
he that cometh from heaven is above all:1
which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth:1
and they went to Damascus:1
that their rulers:1
thirteen cubits:1
walked we not in the same steps:1
he shall come up as clouds:1
that I may walk before God in the light of the living:1
the days shall come upon you:1
they neither marry:2
that was upon it:2
our dance is turned into mourning:1
For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified:1
he ran to meet them from the tent door:1
Because I said:2
The place of the scripture which he read was this:1
but he shall not be gathered:1
epistles of commendation to you:1
And Michael:1
and to everlasting:1
and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah:1
because of the waters of the flood:1
that will I do for thee:1
And he called the multitude:1
but for the glory of God:1
in the place which he should choose:1
which he made:9
my people:224
the girdle was marred:1
when I departed from Macedonia:1
And he made haste:1
And when the burnt offering began:1
when ye are come nigh unto the battle:1
And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle:2
and shed out his bowels to the ground:1
and all the idols of the house of Israel:1
and departeth in darkness:1
I have raised him up in righteousness:1
and into the hand of the king of Babylon:1
And they called for Samson out of the prison house:1
Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do:1
shall I come before him with burnt offerings:1
And they came:33
and your cities waste:1
and be hungry:1
I will make thee fruitful:1
and told them what things Jesus had done:1
and Job were in it:1
And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa:1
that Eli marked her mouth:1
and into the two maidservants:1
There is one alone:1
And the sons of Carmi:1
The stouthearted are spoiled:1
and the other shall be left:1
neither shall he be charged with any business:1
how he maketh intercession to God against Israel saying:1
Wherefore I command thee:1
and wilt thou rear it up in three days:1
as saith the prophet:1
And when Hadad was dead:1
he is clothed with majesty:1
and shall drink no vinegar of wine:1
and rested not:1
and knowledge rather than choice gold:1
yet hath he respect unto the lowly:1
Thy God whom thou servest continually:1
how long shall the wicked triumph:1
and consume you:1
therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness:1
for their ignorance:1
and that this Jesus:1
which were fastened to the throne:1
and what do thy eyes wink at:1
and the truth shall make you free:1
And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land:1
There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone:1
the weasel:1
and forgive the sin of thy people Israel:2
in the seventh day is an holy convocation:1
that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets:1
and attend to the words of my mouth:1
and number ye the people:1
and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:1
And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD:1
Bigthan and Teresh:1
and like oil into his bones:1
with fasting:7
Thou wilt prolong the king:1
even the house of Israel:1
and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul:2
and have dominion over the fish of the sea:1
I have heard him:1
and that dwelt in Judah:1
twelve princes shall he beget:1
and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day:1
that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel:1
And the sons of Hananiah:1
What accusation bring ye against this man:1
Treasures of wickedness profit nothing:1
And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite:1
and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape:1
or for yourselves:1
and they shall be consumed by the sword:1
Haste ye:1
Awake:14
whose name was Jonadab:1
And Isaac said unto his son:1
but God hath called us to peace:1
Oh how great is thy goodness:1
they shall not be sown:1
in the land of Bashan unto Salcah:1
the son of Mahath:1
and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground:1
and shall consume his branches:1
and brought them to Damascus:1
Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn:1
And on the seventh day seven bullocks:1
lying on a bed:1
nor uncircumcision:3
I will cast her into a bed:1
Whom shall I bring up unto thee:1
And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased:1
Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters:1
How didst thou write all these words at his mouth:1
ye careless ones:1
which the Lord hath made known unto us:1
For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body:1
and the remnant shall be the priest:1
Then said some of his disciples among themselves:1
And I punished them oft in every synagogue:1
even this whole land:1
wherein they made them serve:1
nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net:1
to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him:1
that they may see your good works:1
let all his males be circumcised:1
stand thou still upon Gibeon:1
and shalt not turn away from me:1
all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand:1
and they together shall be against Judah:1
all such rejoicing is evil:1
even the Lord:1
She saith unto him:2
and receive us graciously:1
even betwixt us and thee:1
and all his people:11
but a just weight is his delight:1
and there he died before God:1
and Telem:2
Every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it:1
Then shalt thou enquire:1
when they cried unto thee:1
Of Dan:2
And Ahab called Obadiah:1
thou judge of the earth:1
I remembered God:1
There is that scattereth:1
And all wept:1
Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place:1
Lest they should tell on us:1
And Saul arose:2
and it hath lighted upon Israel:1
because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah:1
For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired:1
and to the young ravens which cry:1
And Lot also:1
But blessed are your eyes:1
Ephraim and Manasseh:4
evangelists:1
therefore have they forgotten me:1
against the priests thereof:1
and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity:1
and buyeth that field:1
for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them:1
Upon the wicked he shall rain snares:1
they are glad that thou hast done it:1
For the kingdom is the LORD:1
Make the heart of this people fat:1
Then an herald cried aloud:1
and went and told Jesus:1
and Cyrenians:1
And they three came out:1
It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD:1
and shittim wood:2
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet:2
and about all that he hath on every side:1
which worship God in the spirit:1
Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people:1
offered:140
and the judges thereof:1
children in whom is no faith:1
Even all nations shall say:1
saith the King of Jacob:1
and I have made it:2
they brought thee for a present horns of ivory and ebony:1
and great pain shall be in Ethiopia:1
with the edge of the sword before Barak:1
and I had set up the doors:1
Now therefore be ye not mockers:1
I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house:1
Yet thou hast said:1
whose surname was Mark:3
after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea:1
Lest Satan should get an advantage of us:1
even to their buttocks:1
and I unto the world:1
And they arose out of Midian:1
And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in:1
The speckled shall be thy wages:1
This is the first and great commandment:1
and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour:1
and where thou dwellest:1
follow after the men:1
and they that rejoice:1
and rise no more:1
When she was brought forth:1
And he brought back all the goods:1
nor feed that that standeth still:1
and let their men be put to death:1
and labour on the day:1
Thou shalt fan them:1
for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:1
Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews:1
so they went from them:1
The statutes of the LORD are right:1
because the LORD would slay them:1
and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings:1
he shall surely make it good:1
He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh:1
And they came up into Judah:1
but it tendeth to poverty:1
and they shall be accomplished in that day before thee:1
that he came to deceive thee:1
But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee:1
and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar:1
He took also of the seed of the land:1
The children of Reaiah:1
with the voice of joy and praise:1
Chedorlaomer king of Elam:1
and went not out of the door:1
ye see the man is mad:1
the evidence of things not seen:1
This is the noise that ye have heard:1
and for the time of healing:1
for it repenteth me that I have made them:1
and burned them before all men:1
your God:178
And he had in his right hand seven stars:1
And they that went in:1
And the children of Benjamin said:1
Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us:1
Of Benjamin:1
if the plague be somewhat dark:1
For this is my blood of the new testament:1
Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid:1
and serve him in sincerity and in truth:1
O captive daughter of Zion:1
Lo here:1
Eber:13
that I should not go down to the pit:1
in the midst of thee they commit lewdness:1
he was prince of the Reubenites:1
If thy people go out to battle against their enemy:1
And when he looked on Amalek:1
which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance:1
three against two:1
in this will I be confident:1
And when the sun was up:1
was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep:1
and the woman spake to Saul:1
or of obedience unto righteousness:1
And Joshua fell on his face to the earth:1
For if we be dead with him:1
I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite:1
and of any living thing which is in the waters:1
but unto thy Father which is in secret:1
more than all the Jews:1
and bound him before their eyes:1
or as a thief:1
and delivered into his hand:1
and worshipped the LORD:5
and sow wickedness:1
let me run:1
thou mayest not consume them at once:1
because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme:1
and was buried in Camon:1
Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection:1
Thus will I magnify myself:1
And Jeremiah did so:1
go unto Nineveh:1
for David:10
The men of Bethazmaveth:1
thou shalt not oppress him:1
The LORD is longsuffering:1
It will be fair weather:1
and they say nothing unto him:1
for the firstfruits:2
both of man and beast:2
it shall bruise thy head:1
and her mind was alienated from them:1
and shalt lift up thy face unto God:1
for they have even taken of the accursed thing:1
And one of the multitude answered and said:1
we are in desolate places as dead men:1
and also the ground whereon they are:1
Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together:1
the LORD said unto me:29
as other people:1
And I will purge out from among you the rebels:1
and thou shalt overlay it with brass:1
And when the people were come into the wood:1
it shall be holy unto thee:1
Jael came out to meet him:1
And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth:1
and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth:1
to take away our reproach:1
small and great:11
and my sleep departed from mine eyes:1
that I will break his yoke from off thy neck:1
And blessed is she that believed:1
they are all mighty men:1
that no whoremonger:1
when he dresseth the lamps:1
and none shall help him:1
that whatsoever Ezra the priest:1
and not of evil:1
and her two daughters in law with her:1
wherefore I was afraid:1
and the things that therein are:2
And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears:1
but by the Holy Ghost:1
the flesh profiteth nothing:1
and laid their hands on them:1
so have I strived to preach the gospel:1
and shall Sarah:1
she was cast down to the ground:1
so will he break all my bones:1
for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty:1
And I will also give thee into their hand:1
Thou hast increased the nation:1
nor drunk any water:1
and the top of it reached to heaven:1
and prosper:15
while Saul talked unto the priest:1
And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali:1
from my deadly enemies:1
I have not found so great faith:2
Shall the women eat their fruit:1
And the men of Israel said:2
was the earth dried:1
which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years:1
made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:1
and these children are my children:1
and I am afraid of thy judgments:1
There shall no strange god be in thee:1
they shall drive out Ashdod at the noon day:1
Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness:1
And they glorified God in me:1
asleep on a pillow:1
for the good of all the land of Egypt is your:1
a man of God:7
and fought with Amalek:1
the stone of Israel:1
thou worm Jacob:1
and her daughters shall go into captivity:1
but if he neglect to hear the church:1
And he stood:6
Give me to drink:2
whereon they set down the ark of the LORD:1
So they cast him out of the vineyard:1
and over his image:1
because she overlaid it:1
and have diminished thine ordinary food:1
then take another stick:1
And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee:1
and gather thou the assembly together:1
they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters:1
And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he made hooks for the pillars:1
Quicken me:2
and the border even unto the river Jabbok:1
And did all eat the same spiritual meat:1
Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan:1
and he that killeth a man:1
Insomuch that the multitude wondered:1
which the LORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us:1
And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully:1
I will fill all the inhabitants of this land:1
that my soul may bless thee before I die:1
whether we be Jews or Gentiles:1
for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose:1
Can a maid forget her ornaments:1
Therefore it is come to pass:1
Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished:1
and stood at the door of the tabernacle:1
but now thou art worth ten thousand of us:1
These going before tarried for us at Troas:1
So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned:1
And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream:1
Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David:1
For thou desirest not sacrifice:1
to the dumb stone:1
s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem:1
I have said:13
It shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth:1
of Nemuel:1
and laid wait in the field:1
and ye shall not see me:3
in mount Ebal:2
and we told him according to the tenor of these words:1
and worship him that made heaven:1
but it is far off from us:1
and ointments:2
keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God:1
and wept upon him:1
Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite:1
What time she lifteth up herself on high:1
and saw the women and the children:1
David gave a commandment:1
and agate:1
but on the sabbath it shall be opened:1
and despiseth not any:1
when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him:1
and I will build again the ruins thereof:1
The family of the house of Levi apart:1
But Peter continued knocking:1
whereon there hang a thousand bucklers:1
Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them:1
For false Christs and false prophets shall rise:1
and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence:1
and promised to give him money:1
and publisheth affliction from mount Ephraim:1
Go thy way:7
I go not up yet unto this feast:1
And if he have betrothed her unto his son:1
even to the years of many generations:1
But the LORD said unto me:1
Praise him with the sound of the trumpet:1
neither by Jerusalem:1
and the glory of Christ:1
And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul:1
And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years:1
shineth unto the other part under heaven:1
and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon:1
What are these:5
neither bereave thy nations any more:1
And the flood was forty days upon the earth:1
Upon man:1
but the transgressors shall fall therein:1
and their abominations were according as they loved:1
and the kids of the goats for sin offering twelve:1
he shall let him go free for his tooth:1
wherewith I said I would benefit them:1
but to be in silence:1
ye have planted pleasant vineyards:1
although I was an husband unto them:1
All the vessels of the tabernacle in all the service thereof:1
from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have:1
that it is the firstfruits of Achaia:1
or how knowest thou:1
By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains:1
and Ispah:1
and the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence:1
thou shalt hough their horses:1
neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field:1
but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles:1
and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass:1
whether we wake or sleep:1
and with all on whom she doted:1
Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers:1
and when he had called the saints and widows:1
according to the name of my God:1
which went forth out of this place:1
where was a garden:1
To me belongeth vengeance and recompence:1
wherewith will ye season it:1
Ye are bought with a price:1
And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old:1
as hewers of wood:1
and will save them by the LORD their God:1
and wood to fire:1
as the Holy Ghost saith:1
Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell:1
In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month:1
So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD:1
and this city shall remain for ever:1
Surely our fathers have inherited lies:1
set not thy mind on them:1
Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed:1
And there came a voice out of the cloud:1
that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein:1
Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah:1
would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven:1
Ahira the son of Enan:5
and it be stolen out of the man:1
Get her for me:1
For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:1
and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth:1
I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness:1
Let him turn to his own house:1
he that openeth:2
and that they might have matter for an evil report:1
it is my Father that honoureth me:1
and keep it:2
and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel:1
but ye shall pine away for your iniquities:1
and Shelesh:1
And every base had four brasen wheels:1
to the land of the Canaanites:4
They shall fall by the sword:1
he goeth before you into Galilee:2
and my master left me:1
And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it:1
and a house divided against a house falleth:1
And it was revealed in mine ears by the LORD of hosts:1
And the LORD passed by before him:1
justified God:1
and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle:1
And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above:1
Charge them that are rich in this world:1
but confessed:1
for it was at every year:1
nor speaking thine own words:1
and God in him:1
and as waters that fail:1
These are the sons of Rachel:1
So Moses went down unto the people:1
and by what means we may prevail against him:1
and that they should come and keep the gates:1
is not this the Christ:1
and the rocks are thrown down by him:1
Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds:1
and your spouses shall commit adultery:1
and heardest their cry by the Red sea:1
and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God:1
that watchers come from a far country:1
But mine eyes are unto thee:1
Ye eat the fat:1
And the angel of the LORD said unto her:3
he fell on his face:1
and spake unto her that kept the door:1
s matters would stand:1
and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth:1
let us have grace:1
And it came to pass in the month Chisleu:1
and between unclean fowls and clean:1
so are the sons of men snared in an evil time:1
and to make an atonement for Israel:1
let not your hearts faint:1
for he was a very great man:1
Bless thou the LORD:1
and Perizzites:1
which I pray before thee now:1
I drive out before thee the Amorite:1
But he would not hearken unto her:1
of Shuthelah:2
There is no man that hath left house:2
and had compassion:1
and Dalphon:1
on the other side Jordan:15
Make their nobles like Oreb:1
Every one that passeth among them that are numbered:1
even because ye cannot hear my word:1
These are the words which the LORD hath commanded:1
and stedfast for ever:1
and grace to thy neck:1
and bring it into subjection:1
And as he said these things unto them:1
And he made them a feast:1
they have broken up:1
that whoso will not come up of all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King:1
Thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year in the place which the LORD shall choose:1
destroyed them:26
And the LORD descended in the cloud:1
And God called the dry land Earth:1
And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites:2
behold a door:1
and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ:1
and full of compassion:3
marvel not at the matter:1
and there the chariots of thy glory shall be the shame of thy lord:1
It is manna:1
And Joshua called for them:1
Now therefore go to:2
Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers:1
And they understood none of these things:1
every one that toucheth them shall be holy:1
Let us go after other gods:1
of the sons of Jashen:1
either he is talking:1
And Joshua said unto them:3
When Jesus saw him lie:1
and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid:1
And he commanded him to be kept in Herod:1
In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood:1
and let them go forth:1
and to them which were in Siphmoth:1
The sons of Mahli:1
And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen:1
Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice:1
If the foot shall say:1
And they turned aside thither:1
For if ye forgive men their trespasses:1
The man is near of kin unto us:1
And ye shall know that I am the LORD:4
they were much cast down in their own eyes:1
and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came:1
their soul fainted in them:1
They were not estranged from their lust:1
Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail:1
And David took more wives at Jerusalem:1
my wool and my flax:2
Then Joseph said unto the people:1
And of the sons of Pahathmoab:1
neither did he eat bread with them:1
That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths:1
and went and made as if they had been ambassadors:1
that eateth any manner of blood:2
And there was a cloud that overshadowed them:1
Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king:1
And the number of the burnt offerings:1
and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ:1
before the vail of the sanctuary:1
Immediately therefore I sent to thee:1
even instead of the firstborn of all the children of Israel:1
beside the altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacle:1
that shall he also reap:1
offering peace offerings:1
The LORD liveth:10
Not for thy righteousness:1
as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor:1
he went up into a mountain:2
and I will call on the name of the LORD:1
that shall burn as an oven:1
And be at peace among yourselves:1
but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day:1
so declare unto us:1
like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt:1
And thinkest thou this:1
IT IS A GOOD THING TO GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD:1
that have not known a man by lying with him:1
and saidst unto them:1
and then cometh harvest:1
because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth:1
and the dam sitting upon the young:1
that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by:1
but let not me be dismayed:1
and that no lie is of the truth:1
And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron:1
and giveth them:1
These words spake Jesus in the treasury:1
I will pour out my fury upon them:1
and stealing:1
and they cast lots for her honourable men:1
For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ:1
Curse not the king:1
who prophesied with a harp:1
and girt about the paps with a golden girdle:1
I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever:1
And he departed thence:1
and Abimelech took an axe in his hand:1
But the house of Judah followed David:1
and the land was polluted with blood:1
And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh:1
take away this cup from me:1
For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day:1
have judged already:1
hardly passing it:1
And half Gilead:1
and cities of store:1
and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy:1
which he had being yet uncircumcised:1
thou hast made me an abomination unto them:1
And they said unto Joshua:2
which is by the brink of the river of Arnon:1
in them therefore come and be healed:1
and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations:1
and Simon called Zelotes:1
and which was:4
and the coast turneth to Hosah:1
from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD:1
they shall also prepare a young bullock:1
when they shall pray toward this place:1
which is by the gate:1
of the flock and the herd:1
in the latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword:1
Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore:1
lest they also bid thee again:1
the princes of the tribes:3
so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub:1
and receive it:1
and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant:1
for there is none like thee:1
straightway there remained no strength in me:1
there was an image in the bed:1
that he had done for Israel:1
for this he did once:1
according to the good hand of my God upon me:1
came to Jerusalem:16
which is neither eared nor sown:1
And when he had tarried among them more than ten days:1
If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father:1
blessed shall she be above women in the tent:1
I am in your hand:1
And the dove came in to him in the evening:1
Let me not:4
Jesus answered him:8
neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt:1
And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel:1
and whosoever shall be with thee in the house:1
that they may be cut off:1
but now he is comforted:1
and howl:5
a troop shall overcome him:1
And Isaac said unto them:1
and whereunto shall I resemble it:1
and come out of him:2
and should also bear sons:1
called Didymus:3
Concerning Jesus of Nazareth:1
Deal courageously:1
in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar:1
and told me lies:2
the ship was in the midst of the sea:1
And the Hittites:1
they said one to another:7
and that before the unbelievers:1
her bars are broken:1
believed not:19
And over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagerite:1
and Bani:2
for I have sought thy precepts:1
And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves:1
and thy right hand hath holden me up:1
as all his brethren the Levites do:1
and of the Canaanites:8
Kenaz:11
we receive of him:1
until he stood before the congregation:1
I cannot go into the house of the LORD:1
Hadar:14
For yet a very little while:1
there is no God like thee in the heaven:1
upon the harp will I praise thee:1
then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him:1
and whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee:1
but the earth abideth for ever:1
The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD:1
The princes also of Pharaoh saw her:1
and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people:1
The LORD was as an enemy:1
will I rule over you:1
and a scribe:1
but on whomsoever it shall fall:2
for he uncovereth his near kin:1
And the same John had his raiment of camel:1
or the blind:1
Withhold not correction from the child:1
These things write I unto thee:1
the tribe of Benjamin was taken:1
Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial:1
be gone:12
into the country of the Gadarenes:1
the sword:271
and all their flocks shall be scattered:1
For the indignation of the LORD is upon all nations:1
and he will be yet wiser:1
and he hath defiled the head of his consecration:1
and on the side of their oppressors there was power:1
because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains:1
even the sure mercies of David:1
yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom:1
and there was gathered unto him a great multitude:1
In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it:1
and rejoice in hope of the glory of God:1
This twenty years have I been with thee:1
whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter:1
even a desolation unto this day:1
and caused them to pass through:1
and fell before the throne on their faces:1
Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah:1
And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few:1
but a wounded spirit who can bear:1
who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets:1
and his nails like birds:1
Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD:1
For verily:5
The God of the whole earth shall he be called:1
these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor:1
is contemptible:2
not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think:1
as they came forth from Pharaoh:1
the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it:1
And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes:1
and all the trees of Eden:1
I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body:1
and will not be ashamed:1
and honey:28
and he hearkened unto their voice:1
which is desert:1
Also they were over the bearers of burdens:1
And of the sons of Elizaphan:1
And the princes of Succoth said:1
with the people of old time:1
Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem:1
at the coming in at the doors:1
by understanding hath he established the heavens:1
the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations:1
as at the time of thy reproach of the daughters of Syria:1
And charged them that they should not make him known:1
and pitched in Michmash:1
for so did their fathers to the false prophets:1
and the name of the younger was Rachel:1
and seven rams:7
But ye shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD:1
since the day we heard it:1
and sailed unto Assos:1
and destroy thy pleasant houses:1
or whether they both shall be alike good:1
Let us go up at once:1
both of the most holy:1
that could deliver his people out of mine hand:1
There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel:1
be as I am:1
And so shall be the plague of the horse:1
And I said unto the king:1
and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer:1
which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee:1
And spared not the old world:1
and from the hand of all other:1
He telleth the number of the stars:1
between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin:1
or by death:1
Whithersoever the spirit was to go:1
and of faith toward God:1
And there came two angels to Sodom at even:1
I will pull down my barns:1
he shall come:26
and thou destroyest the hope of man:1
and they two were alone in the field:1
I will trust in thee:2
nor the moon by night:1
a sure foundation:1
And he took the book of the covenant:1
Come ye:6
and hated iniquity:1
or shall I be equal:1
nor Judah of his God:1
And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine:1
then an angel touched him:1
refused to be called the son of Pharaoh:1
and hide thee in the dust:1
were both almost:1
and went throughout all the land of Egypt:1
When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John:1
Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about:1
until Asshur shall carry thee away captive:1
and yet the appetite is not filled:1
upon the side of the tabernacle northward:1
Take these vessels:1
and the feast of ingathering at the year:1
and doeth not:3
and a little child shall lead them:1
And when his disciples James and John saw this:1
set his eyes on him:1
and he shall hear my voice:1
and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied:1
And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that:1
And in that day shall ye say:1
and tempted God in the desert:1
which sword proceeded out of his mouth:1
and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul:1
The troops of Tema looked:1
rulers of thousands:2
and obtain the kingdom by flatteries:1
And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace:1
and Calah:2
and the abomination:2
that in the seventh day the battle was joined:1
And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel:1
and departed without being desired:1
and raised up thy sons:1
Therefore say unto them:1
as John also taught his disciples:1
The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup:1
and than the middlemost of the building:1
and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill:1
that all may learn:1
For Israel hath not been forsaken:1
According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour:1
living in malice and envy:1
if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten:1
I was eyes to the blind:1
and the porch of the gate was inward:1
For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand:1
a son shall be born to thee:1
the children of Sotai:2
and Aholibah her sister:1
thus ye brought an offering:1
The right hand of the LORD is exalted:1
for God is come to prove you:1
and went up through the mountains westward:1
God dwelleth in him:1
they will repent:1
But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back:1
tempted of Satan:1
both of the first year:1
Take the choice of the flock:1
which is desolate:2
He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province:1
go unto the vessels:1
And Israel took his journey with all that he had:1
Now Eli was very old:1
and a young man to my hurt:1
and let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God:1
There is no cause:1
because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him:1
Verily that:1
and went up into a mountain:2
and received in the same year an hundredfold:1
Send therefore to Joppa:1
until I come in peace:1
and they shall rule over their oppressors:1
he also himself likewise took part of the same:1
are not my ways equal:1
the lame take the prey:1
in the sixth month:3
and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it:1
and all judges of the earth:1
And when she was baptized:1
her daughter in law:4
the kingdom of God is within you:1
unto thy people Israel:1
the forgiveness of sins:3
And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables:1
and tried:2
which is good for nothing:1
for they will hear that thou art come:1
and against all Idumea:1
the power of Persia and Media:1
shall he turn away:1
and he gave them victual in abundance:1
insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city:1
the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:1
And it was told Joshua:1
and shall be unclean until the even:1
The strangers shall fade away:1
And they were filled with madness:1
I brought you up from Egypt:1
for I will bring upon it:1
when Saul was king over us:1
And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel:1
the lust of the flesh:2
the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction:1
And there came forth a spirit:1
s household to ride on:1
and they shall dote:1
I opened not my mouth:1
they shall yell as lions:1
and a cubit and an half broad:1
And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel:1
and of Christ:2
and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub:1
therefore understand the matter:1
Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair:1
and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent:1
And the incense altar:1
I will be sorry for my sin:1
so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly:1
remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ:1
and Joshua:16
and look upon it:1
and will increase learning:1
that have no rain:1
What did Moses command you:1
For whether is greater:1
He shall recount his worthies:1
They shall not lament for him:1
and the fire shall try every man:1
tell it unto the church:1
therefore it shall be:2
and all their host have I commanded:1
the son of Jahaziel:1
that we and our cattle should die there:1
seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood:1
and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more:1
and in the country of Pathros:1
of whom we said:1
These are their generations:1
I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon:1
And they came to Ophir:1
and he laid waste their cities:1
looking stedfastly on him:1
than with them:1
also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold:1
because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead:1
and the priests the Levites bearing it:1
and he that hath meat:1
and laid it upon Ephraim:1
and forsake us so long time:1
he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made:1
and one gate of Joseph:1
for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night:1
They angered him also at the waters of strife:1
and drew near:3
beside the plains of Moreh:1
for the children of Issachar according to their families:1
who lay on a bed at noon:1
So the house of the LORD was perfected:1
led with him to be put to death:1
in the likeness of God made he him:1
and thou be angry with them:2
and carried all the feeble of them upon asses:1
as he rejoiced over thy fathers:1
These four were born to the giant in Gath:1
and let us cut them off from being a nation:1
and to thy kindred:2
And Jacob took a stone:1
and shall call his name Immanuel:1
will draw all men unto me:1
for the judgment is God:1
Now go:2
that ye might rebel this day against the LORD:1
and for fear of the army of the Syrians:1
And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:1
and think to change times and laws:1
he setteth himself in a way that is not good:1
twelve chargers of silver:1
And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD:1
All these things will I give thee:1
Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity:1
which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah:1
And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau:1
give me understanding:4
and with them they do hurt:1
the former things are come to pass:1
and his brother:6
come now:3
In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation:1
I am full of the burnt offerings of rams:1
it was white as snow in Salmon:1
These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters:1
and are spent without hope:1
Both male and female shall ye put out:1
and the priest shall execute upon her all this law:1
as the duty of every day required:2
and they shall fear no more:1
and gathereth fruit unto life eternal:1
but thou shalt endure:1
and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags:1
and a time to dance:1
Then she fell on her face:1
he abhorred them:1
a virgin shall conceive:1
and thy lips with rejoicing:1
I counsel thee to keep the king:1
And within were hooks:1
and doeth them:3
They meet with darkness in the day time:1
And take with thee ten loaves:1
and smote their tents:1
and there shall be a very great multitude of fish:1
an ephah for a bullock:2
give ear:21
They shall lay hold on bow and spear:1
and ye shall find them at the end of the brook:1
Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction:1
and Hananiah the ruler of the palace:1
And he stooping down:1
Wherefore he saith also in another psalm:1
they are sottish children:1
And five of them were wise:1
Hodaiah:1
And these things I said not unto you at the beginning:1
notwithstanding:10
them they had not circumcised:1
and kneeling down to him:1
But I will leave a few men of them from the sword:1
and who is holy:1
neither rear you up a standing image:1
silver:299
Kiriathaim is confounded and taken:1
which I had put upon thee:1
when Solomon was old:1
Well done:2
it shall not hurt them:1
The shield of his mighty men is made red:1
For the transgression of Jacob is all this:1
Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city:1
even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the LORD your God:1
the son of Jeroham:7
and on our prophets:1
And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me:1
and when he had found him:1
and glorified God:4
I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire:1
and peace upon Israel:1
they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel:1
and he hath blessed:1
and he saith:9
whose hope is in the LORD his God:1
every one loveth gifts:1
But Peter said unto him:2
and made him a young lion:1
And a fire was kindled in their company:1
And the LORD looked upon him:1
lest ye enter into temptation:2
and girded them with girdles:1
For though I be absent in the flesh:1
and smote certain of them:1
Behold the fire and the wood:1
that were males:1
and our part shall be to deliver him into the king:1
and my fortress:7
for ten baths are an homer:1
the vessels being diverse one from another:1
can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect:1
thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus:1
as one that findeth great spoil:1
and brought them near unto him:1
but this with an oath by him that said unto him:1
even the voice of the day of the LORD:1
and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him:1
the son of Shelemiah:5
concerning him that hath so done this deed:1
Then Solomon spake unto all Israel:1
and against the inhabitants thereof:2
and Lazarus:2
wherewith thou coverest thyself:1
and went out against them:1
And they went out of the prison:1
and parched corn:2
The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof:1
Then went I up in the night by the brook:1
and fought against the Philistines:1
I frame evil against you:1
or whether we be sober:1
The cloths of service:2
And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields:1
they are come unto the city to take it:1
the man that executeth my counsel from a far country:1
Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught:1
and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you:1
But though he had done so many miracles before them:1
When the wicked cometh:1
and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father:1
and have it in possession:1
and is not rich toward God:1
He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon:1
and to the women:1
and they have no hurt:1
by whom also he made the worlds:1
and Hittites:1
transgression increaseth:1
wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling:1
and thou wast pleased with me:1
And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves:1
If:475
and deny thee:1
neither shall seek the young one:1
he will no more regard them:1
And be ready against the third day:1
neither didst remember the latter end of it:1
And Moses said unto Korah:2
that they may follow strong drink:1
and cleaveth the cleft into two claws:1
And when they heard it:3
Preach the word:1
and then I will bring him:1
My bed shall comfort me:1
Thomas:12
And whatsoever shall seem good to thee:1
They were driven forth from among men:1
and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength:1
which ministered unto him of their substance:1
By faith Jacob:1
For the LORD loveth judgment:1
with words of peace and truth:1
And Terah took Abram his son:1
Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak:1
And their forty sockets of silver:2
whose number was in the days of David two and twenty thousand and six hundred:1
shew thyself to the world:1
I will rise now:1
shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever:1
and the priest shall burn it upon the altar:2
that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty:1
and walkest abroad any whither:1
John Baptist hath sent us unto thee:1
who knoweth not such things as these:1
rejoicing:26
thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul:1
and mourned certain days:1
And yet indeed she is my sister:1
This was he of whom I spake:1
For he hath put all things under his feet:1
and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land:1
What is thy beloved more than another beloved:1
and set him in his place again:1
heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up:1
in Pathros:1
and all their transgressions in all their sins:1
On the fifth day Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai:1
God is love:2
for a possession for twenty chambers:1
And the servants also of Huram:1
and let the dry land appear:1
for his root was by great waters:1
which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar:1
and they were healed:2
And they were driven out from Pharaoh:1
is a land for cattle:1
and his heart will work iniquity:1
Ye have heard the blasphemy:1
but the righteous sheweth mercy:1
Now the acts of Rehoboam:1
Of clean beasts:1
and the fellowship of his sufferings:1
O thou my God:1
And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun:1
go up to Bethel:2
and immediately she arose and ministered unto them:1
And they shall make a spoil of thy riches:1
Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah:1
now therefore my husband will love me:1
and the elders of Judah sat before me:1
But I will remove far off from you the northern army:1
and laid it upon the ass:1
And they that stood by said:1
in the valley:60
every one his day:1
And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods:1
He hath put down the mighty from their seats:1
One dieth in his full strength:1
watching daily at my gates:1
the same do I know also:1
inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles:1
The posts of the temple were squared:1
and will look up:1
but if thou wilt not redeem it:1
s side over against him:1
And the saying pleased the whole multitude:1
and said unto him in the sight of all Israel:1
for I am thy fellowservant:1
that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers:1
in the holy place shalt thou cause the strong wine to be poured unto the LORD for a drink offering:1
whom:725
And there are gathered unto him vain men:1
Then came in the magicians:1
So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight:1
And the snuffers:1
and the charge of the altar:1
and took two milch kine:1
him shalt thou serve:1
he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do:1
even before he came near unto them:1
and Rekem:4
the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty:1
and will cause thee to come up from the north parts:1
and upon the many people that are with him:1
they that hate you shall reign over you:1
a blind man:2
And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years:1
according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel:1
And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ:1
and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria:1
and pass on to Azmon:1
and to eat things sacrificed unto idols:1
in the siege:7
or oil:3
and thy strong garrisons shall go down to the ground:1
Nevertheless for thy great mercies:1
And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice:1
and those that have not sought the LORD:1
and will offer an offering made by fire:1
Then contended I with the rulers:1
But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD:1
s that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings:1
Every man shall give as he is able:1
Again I say unto you:1
because they are very strong:1
which shall never be destroyed:1
s son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel:1
he shall fall himself into his own pit:1
And their possessions and habitations were:1
when ye were come forth out of Egypt:1
and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him:1
But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven:1
Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way:1
the world languisheth and fadeth away:1
and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote:1
I will do a thing in Israel:1
Is not this the carpenter:2
My spirit shall not always strive with man:1
separating myself:1
and whensoever ye will ye may do them good:1
Pilate therefore said unto him:1
being matters of controversy within thy gates:1
He hath shewed thee:1
bring him unto me:1
they are thy lot:1
Great men are not always wise:1
thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son:1
thou hast taught me from my youth:1
So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle:1
when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven:1
And they drew out the staves of the ark:1
twice dead:1
Ye shall not bring in the captives hither:1
and the Syrians from Kir:1
as though I shot at a mark:1
for the pillars of the earth are the LORD:1
thy judgments have I laid before me:1
And if a man also strive for masteries:1
I cannot:34
and the king of Admah:1
a man after mine own heart:1
Drink waters out of thine own cistern:1
and he called his name Enos:1
That which is far off:1
blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book:1
and behold:54
and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the LORD thy God:1
then understood I their end:1
He that regardeth the day:1
he daily increaseth lies and desolation:1
and three hundred concubines:1
Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband:1
nor any to answer:1
Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number:1
and condemn them:1
and it was in the valley that lieth by Bethrehob:1
Whether he have gored a son:1
and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace:1
And the border passed along to the side of Bethhoglah northward:1
he drove them all out of the temple:1
I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine:1
The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him:1
fluttereth over her young:1
they seek a sign:1
compassed the house round:1
and unto all the congregation:2
And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh:1
nor come nigh unto the altar:1
And we beseech you:1
and entreat them evil four hundred years:1
Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God:1
he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself:1
and measured the earth:1
and her paths unto the dead:1
it groweth up:2
And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass:1
and made him king in his father:1
And Aijalon with her suburbs:1
and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters:1
and thou shalt take hold:1
O ye shepherds:1
For Jacob my servant:1
neither will he go unto the wise:1
and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God:1
neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed:1
and the priest shall pronounce him unclean:1
and from the north:2
and could not speak peaceably unto him:1
which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow:1
therefore made he thee king over them:1
which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding:1
for this is all my salvation:1
For the turning away of the simple shall slay them:1
and come ye again to me with the certainty:1
And when they were come up out of the water:1
And the sons of Zeruiah:1
and every one whom his spirit made willing:1
neither in tongue:1
can faith save him:1
and brasen walls against the whole land:1
Who both killed the Lord Jesus:1
my prayer is unto thee:1
your fervent mind toward me:1
And when he looked behind him:1
Why transgressest thou the king:1
both the floor of the house:1
And forgive us our sins:1
and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts:1
Chasten thy son while there is hope:1
Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us:1
and there can be no opening:1
He brought them out:2
So the altar shall be four cubits:1
enter thou into the joy of thy lord:2
and exercised robbery:1
for there is none to help:1
and Zabdi:2
Samson:39
both man:11
they may by your good works:1
the men laid hold upon his hand:1
Why should he go with thee:1
With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication:1
And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek:1
Then there came out a spirit:1
an hundred rams:1
for I fear God:1
whom Milcah bare unto him:1
And patience:1
he will not depart from it:1
Or saith he it altogether for our sakes:1
surely now he would awake for thee:1
and root thee out of the land of the living:1
therefore will I hope in him:1
and make merry:1
This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot:1
and their drink offerings:14
with joy:28
and lay in sackcloth:1
and fetched from thence gold:1
and dress it first:1
And Ahimaaz begat Azariah:1
was thine anger against the rivers:1
I have roasted flesh:1
Neither is worshipped with men:1
whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good:1
But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly:1
and in Benjamin:2
and risen again from the dead:1
And they were all amazed:6
whose house are we:1
Moab is destroyed:1
and they shall fight every one against his brother:1
and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries:1
and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large:1
that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD:1
art good:3
which dwelleth at Jerusalem:1
for it shall not come near thee:1
and cried after Saul:1
Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God:1
neither is there any water:2
that I may know how frail I am:1
And when they saw him afar off:1
this is my covenant with them:1
the second to Gedaliah:1
and the land become full of wickedness:1
and the thunder shall cease:1
What mean ye by this service:1
Gather the people together:2
then said I:1
who store up violence and robbery in their palaces:1
For the wicked boasteth of his heart:1
Even so we:1
and the people sought him:1
Depart yet for three days:1
in stone:4
and would none of my reproof:1
which they themselves also allow:1
and will consume thy filthiness out of thee:1
that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother:1
who is offended:1
for we have spoken against the LORD:1
Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe:1
Isaac:131
To whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah:1
and they returned to Jerusalem:1
to pray before the LORD:3
The God of my rock:1
and unto Naphtali:1
and their judges:1
ye were free from righteousness:1
so is he that giveth honour to a fool:1
and killed him:4
they will seek thy life:1
and I hate every false way:1
an astonishment:12
and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver:1
as the truth is in Jesus:1
Thou art my mother:1
in that they eat with the blood:1
Come again unto me after three days:1
thou afflicted:3
and yet offend in one point:1
s desire which he was pleased to do:1
to cause thee to hear it with thine ears:1
and come forth:1
but in fleshy tables of the heart:1
costly stones:4
Do not condemn me:1
And they returned to Joshua:1
That which is crooked cannot be made straight:1
or addeth thereto:1
an hundred and forty and four cubits:1
he was sent on foot into the valley:1
And there was a man of mount Ephraim:1
And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him:1
He is a good man:2
And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver:1
then shall his yoke depart from off them:1
when he died:7
Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:1
or if a man shall dig a pit:1
And saith unto them:2
And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham:1
neither shall the God of Jacob regard it:1
to bring it into the king:1
he offered them money:1
Ye shall not see me henceforth:1
and cast their crowns before the throne:1
and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year:1
For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith:1
and let us give them our daughters:1
and cried out with a loud voice:1
for he is raised up out of his holy habitation:1
The length of one curtain was thirty cubits:1
all the words that I command thee to speak unto them:1
For in one hour so great riches is come to nought:1
and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation:1
at the commandment of Hezekiah the king:1
The rich man is wise in his own conceit:1
the planting of the LORD:1
and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them:1
and it was dried up:1
and Mattithiah:3
with rejoicing and with singing:1
and keep his way:1
and in the spirit of meekness:1
Jupiter:3
and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward:1
I have heard thy prayer:3
whether he rage or laugh:1
the planters shall plant:1
But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years:1
And whether one member suffer:1
they have made them a molten image:1
therefore shall he wash his flesh in water:1
that no swarms of flies shall be there:1
and the decree was given at Shushan:1
for they have rewarded evil unto themselves:1
But put forth thine hand now:2
His bones are full of the sin of his youth:1
and in the earth:4
I cried to thee:1
and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king:1
and a bear met him:1
but his heart is not with thee:1
which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day:1
freely ye have received:1
s enemies:35
and confirmed them:1
And if Satan cast out Satan:1
for the morning and evening burnt offerings:1
and brass as rotten wood:1
for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine:1
according to the revelation of the mystery:1
And so Pilate:1
even my fierce anger:1
woe unto us:1
we went through all that great and terrible wilderness:1
And I will take away mine hand:1
if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled:1
secondarily prophets:1
mine eye is consumed with grief:1
Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD:1
and made it dark:1
and an house for his kingdom:2
as I do this day:1
despiteful:6
So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me:1
And Jacob went on his way:1
where were the body:1
This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you:1
But he told not his father:1
And the children of Israel said unto the LORD:1
But when a stronger than he shall come upon him:1
but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish:1
there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns:1
Train up a child in the way he should go:1
and all the rulers of the provinces:2
that I may comfort thee:1
and behold it with thine eyes:1
and his pillars:1
when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews:1
and utter his voice from his holy habitation:1
whosoever hath killed any person:1
And he went out from Pharaoh:2
For if we would judge ourselves:1
to be rulers of thousands:1
and without a teaching priest:1
And touching the house of the king of Judah:1
and thine household:1
but these things I say:1
But I would not have you to be ignorant:1
and begin not to say within yourselves:1
But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the LORD withal:1
But a prophet of the LORD was there:1
knowing that:17
not given to much wine:2
and to the spirits of just men made perfect:1
All their cities throughout their families were thirteen cities:1
but will ye weary my God also:1
The fire of God is fallen from heaven:1
and shed blood:2
but they would not hearken:1
or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken:1
His head and his hairs were white like wool:1
if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances:1
and set forth:1
These things said he:2
so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips:1
But Jehoshaphat said:1
that he might destroy them utterly:1
The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water:1
And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families:1
or loweth the ox over his fodder:1
thou hast said the truth:1
the priests going on:2
and the meat offering thereof:1
which are not after thy law:1
being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:1
but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls:1
for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him:1
yet now henceforth know we him no more:1
which while some coveted after:1
then who can hinder him:1
I AM the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath:1
Be not afraid of them:2
my ministers:1
and whosoever shall receive me:2
of the kindred of Ram:1
In God I will praise his word:1
Who will bring me into the strong city:2
And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding:1
and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years:1
draw her and all her multitudes:1
He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered:1
Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her towns:1
And lest:4
for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves:1
and the word is not in them:1
and sprinkled it on the people:1
that I might come even to his seat:1
that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years:1
and it trembleth:1
yet no man said:1
Ye shall not need to fight in this battle:1
neither was I quiet:1
and giveth him not for his work:1
set a man over the congregation:1
immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was:1
but he that endureth to the end shall be saved:1
in due time Christ died for the ungodly:1
neither after them shall be such:1
Then said the LORD:13
but have everlasting life:1
according unto thy word:5
thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place:1
For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them:1
though they have hired among the nations:1
which have gotten cattle and goods:1
and meddle not with them that are given to change:1
even in the month which he had devised of his own heart:1
Thou knowest the thing that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadeshbarnea:1
When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation:1
and having salvation:1
and the heavens above be black:1
and shalt dwell therein:1
afterward thou shalt be called:1
thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn:1
Ater:5
and she be not defiled:1
and yet is:2
and they shall throw down thine eminent place:1
bemoan him:2
in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite:1
The calamity of Moab is near to come:1
and they lifted up their eyes:2
And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together:1
and the children of Ammon shall obey them:1
And I knew that thou hearest me always:1
Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee:1
I go unto my people:1
And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire:1
Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother:1
for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother:1
And Samuel lay until the morning:1
Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending:1
having received such a charge:1
and the snuffers:2
and some men they follow after:1
even of the tribe of Reuben:1
thither go:1
And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth:1
that he might instruct thee:1
after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam:1
and there arose a smoke out of the pit:1
In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps:1
both of the new moons:1
therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth:1
I will bring evil upon this people:1
If he will contend with him:1
for them that defile themselves with mankind:1
So the servants of the householder came and said unto him:1
as Barnabas:1
And the wall of the city had twelve foundations:1
son of Milcah:2
For dogs have compassed me:1
But those riches perish by evil travail:1
surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them:1
And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada:1
that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail:1
which I also hate:1
when I was come again to Jerusalem:1
for he could not frame to pronounce it right:1
that they defile not their camps:1
the same is Zoar:1
blasphemers:2
which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem:1
he loveth to oppress:1
your breath:1
Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar:1
O Daniel:4
and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly:1
And I will bring back all the people unto thee:1
He is my refuge and my fortress:1
The LORD hath not chosen these:1
And the king took off his ring:1
for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous:1
all the days of Cyrus king of Persia:1
And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab:1
And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold:1
and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals:1
And thou shalt speak unto him:3
and they are written for our admonition:1
because that ye had heard that he had been sick:1
And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai:1
therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen:1
There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom:1
and the heritage of oppressors:1
the land of their pilgrimage:1
and God doeth it:1
Howbeit the high places were not taken away:1
That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow:1
Barnabas and Paul:3
Zacchaeus:3
Give glory to the LORD your God:1
And that he was buried:1
and go about the city in the streets:1
and the scribes:12
And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death:1
And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth:1
in the land of Edom:7
And Joab blew the trumpet:1
we shall not die:1
and some another:1
O land:3
Is any sick among you:1
his daughters:16
and I will carry you away beyond Babylon:1
Wherefore laying aside all malice:1
and encamped at Eziongaber:1
I know him not:2
That no flesh should glory in his presence:1
Paul was pressed in the spirit:1
or shall we not give:1
behold a hole in the wall:1
The LORD hath utterly separated me from his people:1
and fell on his neck:2
in persecutions:1
letter was read before Rehum:1
or for the uprightness of thine heart:1
with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast:1
s servants digged a well:1
and I shall be safe:1
Exact no more than that which is appointed you:1
And his brethren by their families:1
and the chapiters which were on the top of the two pillars:1
Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD:1
And Moses commanded the children of Israel:2
and the LORD shall save me:1
go they forth to their work:1
shall give an offering unto the LORD:1
nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:1
When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion:1
None devoted:1
The king also said unto them:1
And it came to pass at that time:4
And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians:1
Feed my sheep:2
the generation of the upright shall be blessed:1
And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables:1
O my God:21
so shall it come to pass:1
And fields shall be bought in this land:1
and they came to Helam:1
able to deliver thee from the lions:1
lie again on thy right side:1
which is by the river Arnon:1
let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river:1
and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth:1
and they shall dwell in their own land:1
And he sent:20
and Rebekah his wife conceived:1
And they came near before Eleazar the priest:1
he kindleth it:1
And the sons of Merari by their families:1
it is thy brother:1
the LORD our God delivered all unto us:1
honour:196
he shall feed them:2
By faith Moses:2
and brought them into the temple of Babylon:1
year after year:1
Why reason ye:2
and the fourth shall be far richer than they all:1
and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side:1
and him as good as dead:1
The altar of wood was three cubits high:1
because the LORD hath said unto him:1
She looketh well to the ways of her household:1
And Jehoiada took for him two wives:1
Is not God in the height of heaven:1
and therefore I abhorred them:1
and came to Jordan:2
and set the staves on the ark:1
then they obeyed:1
were to come after seven days from time to time with them:1
and with Jacob:1
and companies:1
I will plant in the wilderness the cedar:1
they laid the beams thereof:1
Because Haman the son of Hammedatha:1
and the lamps:2
and they brought them unto the valley of Achor:1
and said unto me:11
all these drew the sword:2
when he shall enter into thy gates:1
whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters:1
for I have created him for my glory:1
Thou therefore endure hardness:1
even the gold of the offering:1
and did not then wait by course:1
and burnt his children in the fire:1
was cast into prison:3
and made a feast to all his servants:1
Therefore he said that he would destroy them:1
The son of Hashabiah:1
and steal away from me:1
For I desired mercy:1
the daughter of Bethuel:3
Stand now with thine enchantments:1
Saul leaned upon his spear:1
and his life to the destroyers:1
that none shall remain in it:1
and with our fathers:1
obey in all things your masters according to the flesh:1
thus have they done in the midst of mine house:1
then she shall live:1
to bring me up:1
The hangings of one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits:1
he speaketh boldly:1
He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD:1
Take me an heifer of three years old:1
And if ye shall say:1
and sockets thereof:1
And seeing the multitudes:1
and among the Ammonites:1
Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison:1
And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry:1
Now if we be dead with Christ:1
and repent:14
because he hath said:1
Who have said:1
And if he smite out his manservant:1
and cometh to shame:1
that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth:1
And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day:1
which have the firstfruits of the Spirit:1
and uttered my words to him:1
when I turn back your captivity before your eyes:1
he forgetteth not the cry of the humble:1
brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation:1
send now prosperity:1
when I shall brandish my sword before them:1
it maketh rich:1
Then they returned:1
he hath destroyed his places of the assembly:1
Azariah:41
And Abraham was an hundred years old:1
If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass:1
his expectation shall perish:1
and the height thereof thirty cubits:2
the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people:1
and troubled the water:1
and Parmenas:1
but the LORD made the heavens:2
And Peter remembered the word of Jesus:1
if I will not open you the windows of heaven:1
and fell on their faces to the ground:1
and I will dwell in the midst of thee:2
if this cup may not pass away from me:1
By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land:1
and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin which he hath sinned:1
lift up thy voice with strength:1
even to Horeb:1
as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings:1
Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me:1
and ye are very old:1
and all manner of ware:1
Thus saith the Holy Ghost:1
that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power:1
But if:131
but the sons of Rehabiah were very many:1
wherein he hath sinned:1
And God:84
and the height of it thirty cubits:1
that I should be afraid:1
for with thee will I break in pieces the nations:1
Now after this it came to pass:1
Let thistles grow instead of wheat:1
For if I have boasted any thing to him of you:1
Dread not:1
the son of Mary:1
whether poor or rich:1
and all the vessels of the altar:1
which thou shalt inherit in the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it:1
he marvelled at him:1
which is beside Eloth:1
but they shall bear their shame:1
upon the border of it:1
and a great one:1
I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire:1
neither spake unto them:1
believest thou:2
In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah:1
ready armed to the war:2
and put away evil from Israel:1
than for you:2
A voice of the cry of the shepherds:1
Tell ye the daughter of Sion:1
And they removed from Eziongaber:1
As concerning the gospel:1
Blessed be the Lord:2
in Gibeah:12
For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you:1
and saw there an harlot:1
unto the camp at the plains of Moab:1
he shall not lose his reward:1
and millet:1
thinking to have brought good tidings:1
and Gemariah the son of Shaphan:1
hold him fast:1
these eighteen years:1
Then took they up stones to cast at him:1
Mark well:1
and teach ye them that know them not:1
I would declare unto him the number of my steps:1
I have given you every herb bearing seed:1
and the garlick:1
And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines:1
and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee:1
and some:31
and carrying bows:1
And all the city was gathered together at the door:1
I desired Titus:1
or upon the uncircumcision also:1
for which I am also in bonds:1
and yet no mischief follow:1
He also that had received two talents came and said:1
and the dry land springs of water:1
whither the men went I wot not:1
And I said:33
What man is he that desireth life:1
But godliness with contentment is great gain:1
when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together:1
Then answered one of the people:1
there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD:1
For thou hast been a strength to the poor:1
there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia:1
though a man declare it unto you:1
Tribulation and anguish:1
and if I enter into the city:1
when they approach unto the most holy things:1
which ye shall observe to do in the land:1
for thou hast created all things:1
Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads:1
willing to justify himself:1
And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war:1
The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him:1
from which Judas by transgression fell:1
Then they rent their clothes:1
and despise the other:2
and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother:1
This is the thing which the LORD commanded:3
but no man laid hands on him:2
and that also they have walked contrary unto me:1
and Jezliah:1
And they shall take up a lamentation for thee:1
the chosen of God:1
And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram:1
and the graven image:1
and Azariah the son of Obed:1
which Moses put there at Horeb:1
how then should we steal out of thy lord:1
Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel:1
return thou:3
He scorneth the multitude of the city:1
for the emptiers have emptied them out:1
a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom:1
And he took them the same hour of the night:1
And the people came to the house of God:1
to burn every evening:1
try my reins and my heart:1
So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem:1
and another unto dishonour:1
Notwithstanding ye would not go up:1
What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel:1
O sir:1
for the king had so commanded concerning him:1
when that company died:1
of wines on the lees well refined:1
no man shall abide there:1
for I will surely shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy father:1
Say unto Aaron:3
And it was told Joab:1
Why loose ye the colt:1
Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai:5
and in my name shall his horn be exalted:1
The LORD also spake unto Joshua:1
Ilai the Ahohite:1
and went about to kill me:1
every one in his business:1
For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith:1
to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place:1
Go shew these things unto James:1
wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God:1
because they strove with him:1
and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem:1
They gave me also gall for my meat:1
to go a whoring after them:1
that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words:1
and bought it:1
and shall see this land no more:1
For these Levites:1
Even so the tongue is a little member:1
the voice of the bridegroom:5
But let him that glorieth glory in this:1
and when thy father cometh to see thee:1
Deliver me from all my transgressions:1
and he shall separate them one from another:1
and Uzal:2
that thou mayest save thine own life:1
Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy:1
Now Sarai Abram:1
and with horsemen:2
Honour the king:1
enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared:1
that we may see it:1
and he will smite the great house with breaches:1
Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel:1
And when Azubah was dead:1
tell thy lord:3
Here am I:14
but he that refraineth his lips is wise:1
he clave the rock also:1
And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time:2
and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths:1
but mine own vineyard have I not kept:1
Shamir:4
at the mount of Olives:1
and spread a purple cloth thereon:1
and set him on a pinnacle of the temple:1
Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine:1
and not to destruction:1
Prophesy upon these bones:1
and in all thy company which is in the midst of thee:1
and he that ministered to my wants:1
And he humbled thee:1
without an inhabitant:8
And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah:1
Now therefore why tempt ye God:1
for by the mounting up of Luhith with weeping shall they go it up:1
And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons:1
and Ahab went to meet Elijah:1
when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels:1
for both they and their camels were without number:1
and rested in all the coasts of Egypt:1
on the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen:1
it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations:1
and brought them forth:1
And they rose up before Moses:1
we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left:1
which devoured them:1
the rams sixty:1
and let us flee:1
So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting:1
out of whom he had cast seven devils:1
This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting:1
and the Cherethites:3
They say:16
haste:124
and shall declare thy mighty acts:1
came and fell down before him:1
But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul:1
after the houses of our fathers:1
And went again into the judgment hall:1
For I will declare mine iniquity:1
as the elect of God:1
and his ambassadors came to Hanes:1
and her house:2
And Jesus answered and said unto it:1
but the just shall put it on:1
The crown of pride:1
and his word was in my tongue:1
they shall take thy sons and thy daughters:1
Let no man despise thy youth:1
Stand still:1
and laud him:1
and all Judah and Benjamin:1
and the earth for depth:1
Rejoice with me:2
the LORD our God made a breach upon us:1
and scall:1
Then his lord:1
as we have not touched thee:1
according to these words:3
but the scriptures must be fulfilled:1
the multitude must needs come together:1
And so did he in the cities of Manasseh:1
in the ears of the people that are on the wall:1
Then I went on to the gate of the fountain:1
we are servants in it:1
Then David said:5
But my servant Caleb:1
Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit:1
And say to the forest of the south:1
which he hath committed:1
O man:7
the ministers of the house:2
journey in the wilderness of Etham:1
and twenty cubits in breadth:1
how I hid an hundred men of the LORD:1
then let them speak:1
But many that are first shall be last:2
This is the land that yet remaineth:1
God made him to prosper:1
Having the understanding darkened:1
of my hand shalt thou require him:1
and the mountains were covered:1
hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark:1
he will joy over thee with singing:1
God came from Teman:1
nor their daughters:1
and were delivered:1
These six were born unto him in Hebron:1
is full of thy mercy:1
patience:34
Elkanah his son:2
according to the commandment of king Josiah:1
for in your days:1
for one lamb:3
And Rehoboam slept with his fathers:2
and we will destroy the heir also:1
for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed:1
this is Elias:1
and the holy vessels of God:1
eighteen:28
There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger:1
and which was before the building toward the north:1
The shew of their countenance doth witness against them:1
and Adoniram was over the levy:1
and the priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD:1
and the burning ague:1
Azmaveth the Barhumite:1
where he abode:1
and as Carmel by the sea:1
and as broad as they:1
This is the law of the burnt offering:2
And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley:1
and in thickets:1
for instruction in righteousness:1
only he who now letteth will let:1
and all they that had been of his acquaintance before:1
and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation:1
Thy foundation shall be laid:1
by the hand of strangers:2
In the body of his flesh through death:1
and they shall die:2
and the Father in me:2
He was a murderer from the beginning:1
and the priest shall say unto the woman:1
and no oppressor shall pass through them any more:1
that we may fight against the Canaanites:1
And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write:1
draw near together:1
Hide not from me:1
one gate of Benjamin:1
And the little chambers thereof were three on this side and three on that side:1
we are made as the filth of the world:1
ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven:1
the time of their visitation:5
Of their flesh shall ye not eat:1
Doth the plowman plow all day to sow:1
Hearken unto me now therefore:1
Give ye them to eat:2
and her daughter laid upon the bed:1
because she was the mother of all living:1
for Hadarezer had war with Tou:1
But let every man prove his own work:1
I make myself a transgressor:1
he even built them for it within:1
Fear and dread shall fall upon them:1
And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary:1
and the moon stayed:1
O thou preserver of men:1
and I am your God:1
and the name of the other Ruth:1
and hath said unto me:1
for they prophesy a lie unto you:2
And he departed:3
and moreover we saw the children of Anak there:1
And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone:1
that I sojourn in Mesech:1
and when he came home:1
and filled them with earth:1
and mine eye shall weep sore:1
as the LORD shall speak unto me:1
and those things that were done:1
Knowest thou not this of old:1
to hear the bleatings of the flocks:1
and I will set it up:1
and the lifter up of mine head:1
Come up to me into the mount:1
They shall have like portions to eat:1
I beseech thee for my son Onesimus:1
and the troop of robbers spoileth without:1
Ephah:5
and smote off his ear:1
So I prophesied as I was commanded:1
because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort:1
and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited:1
I will praise thee:12
for it is a wood:1
he was honourable among the thirty:1
Milalai:1
and devoured him:1
and knoweth not whither he goeth:1
and a time to sew:1
for I have slain a man to my wounding:1
Philip saith unto him:2
the desire of our soul is to thy name:1
And thou Bethlehem:1
he doth catch the poor:1
An evil disease:1
that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee:1
for the LORD hath spoiled their pasture:1
but yet the word which I shall say unto thee:1
and to the children of Reuben:2
and bound him:10
Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel:1
and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right:1
and shall give the vineyard to others:1
thou shalt shew her all her abominations:1
And brought them out:1
Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury:1
And they drew nigh unto the village:1
And he took the people:1
skins dyed red:5
For they are the spirits of devils:1
and by the word of their testimony:1
I spake as a child:1
and which is heaved up:1
And Cain talked with Abel his brother:1
and have gone the way which the LORD sent me:1
For I am the LORD your God:1
and found Abishag a Shunammite:1
but unto holiness:1
or to banishment:1
when Jesus had finished all these sayings:1
And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph:1
The king answered unto Daniel:1
and Canaan:4
that God is greater than man:1
And I turned myself and came down from the mount:1
Thy dream:1
The wicked desireth the net of evil men:1
And they brought it:2
houses:136
he shall build the house unto my name:1
and measured it round about:1
and his lords:3
and were well filled:1
And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father:1
and there were precious stones in it:1
that I may appoint over her:2
and if a son:1
and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness:1
and Tirhanah:1
Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle:1
and the name of his city was Avith:2
Which forsaketh the guide of her youth:1
And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour:1
then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward:1
when the vilest men are exalted:1
and likewise his scrip:1
the heads of them were two hundred:1
because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD:1
it is a dry scall:1
and pitched in Makheloth:1
hide the outcasts:1
And Paul chose Silas:1
where is the good way:1
and unto thee shall the vow be performed:1
and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof:1
sing praises:15
wait thou only upon God:1
for we must hold a feast unto the LORD:1
Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame:1
And David dwelt in the castle:1
For thy word:1
With him will I speak mouth to mouth:1
which is by the tabernacle:2
but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded:1
and called:73
And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto him:1
and prayed before the God of heaven:1
and a covert from the tempest:1
journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea:1
The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat:1
they shall be greatly ashamed:2
make you clean:1
they came to meet us as far as Appii forum:1
he shined forth from mount Paran:1
and will give them in possession:1
To whom shall I speak:1
and in the south:3
she turned herself back:1
and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days:1
And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD:1
and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee:1
wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem:1
they increased from Bashan unto Baalhermon and Senir:1
why then doth Adonijah reign:1
and let the people be assembled:1
and thou shalt be blind:1
And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh:1
it shall be perfect to be accepted:1
but he shall be free at home one year:1
but if he be very wroth:1
When heaven is shut up:1
In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised:1
and the dogs to tear:1
and stalls for all manner of beasts:1
No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper:1
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom:1
And while he yet spake with them:1
let us sing unto the LORD:1
art become their God:1
and slay the priests of the LORD:1
And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon:1
which refuseth to be healed:1
I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon:1
And Joseph brought them out from between his knees:1
all that see them shall flee away:1
and not to his posterity:1
and asked whether Simon:1
Perizzites:18
that thou bring not blood upon thine house:1
and all the instruments of their service:1
and the LORD do that which seemeth him good:1
For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good:1
and abode with him:3
albeit I have not spoken:1
in the reign of Artaxerxes the king:1
because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza:2
and they smote him with their hands:1
even upon them shall be no rain:1
whose antiquity is of ancient days:1
Therefore David enquired again of God:1
I say:212
nor a lawgiver from between his feet:1
there is liberty:1
when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance:1
and for all that came unto king Solomon:1
for the LORD hath spoken it:5
And truly:2
But God commendeth his love toward us:1
and thou succeedest them:2
neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land:1
Let them praise his name in the dance:1
And cover not their iniquity:1
The Lord GOD:6
which thy sons and thy daughters should eat:1
Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD:1
Also their love:1
Therefore rejoice:1
And as they went about to kill him:1
Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them:1
so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart:1
and the bows:1
wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins:1
that I have formed it:1
and there is no unrighteousness in him:1
every one with her mate:1
And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days:1
and all creeping things that creep upon the earth:1
to pronounce it clean:1
and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea:1
And they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin:1
And when she had so said:1
And as for the perfume which thou shalt make:1
when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites:1
I said therefore unto you:1
and took an handful thereof:1
wherein is blemish:1
but I am not heard:1
Where were white:1
because she lay sore upon him:1
Art thou called being a servant:1
but safety is of the LORD:1
Go and sit down to meat:1
having made peace through the blood of his cross:1
And Joseph brought in Jacob his father:1
Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross:1
For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king:1
stretched forth over their heads above:1
and three measures of barley for a penny:1
and stood before Pharaoh:1
and put their feet upon the necks of them:1
I will fetch wine:1
for ofttimes he falleth into the fire:1
their vineyards:2
and thou dost dwell among scorpions:1
with mighty men:1
Then said Achish unto his servants:1
And Ezekias begat Manasses:1
for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified:1
And they leaped upon the altar which was made:1
Hebron:79
And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee:1
Where is thy God:2
And Moses charged the people the same day:1
as Pharaoh had commanded:1
but not well:1
And if ye have erred:1
that she came down by the covert on the hill:1
Leah was tender eyed:1
I found trouble and sorrow:1
I create the fruit of the lips:1
they shall stumble:2
then a great ransom cannot deliver thee:1
And I gave Gilead unto Machir:1
and saw no evil:1
against man or beast:1
and by a foolish nation I will anger you:1
the son of Amzi:1
Binnui:7
knock:10
Elijah:45
and looked:25
he will laugh at the trial of the innocent:1
Are here all thy children:1
So they brought the ark of God:1
Binding his foal unto the vine:1
To declare the name of the LORD in Zion:1
And they stood before Moses:1
O LORD of hosts:9
He is despised and rejected of men:1
lest we be chargeable unto thee:1
and shall be for a lamentation:1
So the last shall be first:1
But I have built an house of habitation for thee:1
and will perform it:1
Whomsoever I shall kiss:2
And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre:1
but they came with one accord to him:1
how say ye unto Pharaoh:1
But ye have a custom:1
and the creeping thing:2
thou art my trust from my youth:1
A false witness that speaketh lies:1
For they cast down every man his rod:1
and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months:1
This is the second death:1
he was found of them:2
and said that he was a god:1
And they shall be all taught of God:1
When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt:1
Eleazar begat Phinehas:1
To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art:1
And the priest shall burn them upon the altar:2
and began to cast out them that sold therein:1
which cannot be numbered for multitude:1
Look not on his countenance:1
and came unto mount Hor:1
for the hour is coming:1
that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa:1
but unto thy name give glory:1
speak:597
Also regard not your stuff:1
and found others standing idle:1
the rock of my strength:1
Here is the patience and the faith of the saints:1
the doors of the parlour were locked:1
that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem:1
and is at rest:1
and I will make the place of my feet glorious:1
And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh:1
for every matter pertaining to God:1
but a faithful man who can find:1
and as vinegar upon nitre:1
forgive:107
And when he had begun to reckon:1
that he might know how much every man had gained by trading:1
and the most High uttered his voice:1
Righteous art thou:2
or any thing of skins:1
and what ye hear in the ear:1
I the LORD have spoken it:12
But unto thee have I cried:1
The arrow cannot make him flee:1
Then went king David in:1
that we also might reign with you:1
Reprove not a scorner:1
Let them wander up and down for meat:1
thou hast offered a meat offering:1
but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure:1
will one plow there with oxen:1
both into prison:1
But mine enemies are lively:1
To execute vengeance upon the heathen:1
s commandment by his chamberlains:1
Shall I then take my bread:1
the fear of the LORD is his treasure:1
Go ye therefore:2
ye or your children:1
arose and departed out of Keilah:1
That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten:1
that they have no covering in the cold:1
and took the reed:1
Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of:1
and the Spirit of God was upon him also:1
and shalt serve thy brother:1
my daughter:24
the eighth:34
The cities:3
Jeremai:1
so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof:1
and bindeth up:2
on the south three gates:1
and shalt be buried there:1
and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights:1
with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt:1
he brake the whole staff of bread:1
the God of David thy father:1
ye eat:22
And it came to pass by the way in the inn:1
and caused it not to rain upon another city:1
A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness:1
Then the Levites arose:1
Wherefore ye must needs be subject:1
which are called by their names:1
Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in:1
because she was fair to look upon:1
and to thy son David:1
and the length thereof ninety cubits:1
six hundred shekels of gold went to one target:1
And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering:1
The son of Abinadab:1
reprove:34
Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near:1
or his manservant:2
The LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof:1
and his dwelling was with the wild asses:1
until he came to Naioth in Ramah:1
that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves:1
namely:20
Festus said with a loud voice:1
and brought it to him from year to year:1
even the ruler of the people:1
And the doors shall be shut in the streets:1
and I was not sick:1
For what pleasure hath he in his house after him:1
that he did for Israel:1
And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him:1
were two thousand and seven hundred chief fathers:1
and commit a trespass against the LORD:1
moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass:1
yet will I not deny thee:1
with thy cunning men:1
and in the beginnings of your months:1
as some of them also murmured:1
when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin:1
For it is better:1
He leadeth counsellors away spoiled:1
And supper being ended:1
he dismissed the assembly:1
And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud:1
and spit in his face:1
cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter:1
and I will cause them to lie down:1
And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils:2
and did not cease:1
And when all the land of Egypt was famished:1
and God said:3
and that believing ye might have life through his name:1
so they were before Judah:1
that the hand of the LORD hath done this:1
and beckoning with his hand said:1
there is none beside me:3
and he that is holpen shall fall down:1
So Joshua arose:1
so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded:1
nor bless them at all:1
and Jazer with her suburbs:1
Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden:1
My Father worketh hitherto:1
But all that heard him were amazed:1
and of the vale:1
and Aziel:1
And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the south side of the Jebusite:1
And the haft also went in after the blade:1
and abide in his love:1
certainly in vain made he it:1
come not near to me:1
he lay down:5
strengthening all the disciples:1
I have hated them that regard lying vanities:1
they worship:8
as the camp is to set forward:1
And when there arose a great dissension:1
Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty:1
Whom dost thou pass in beauty:1
and observe my statutes:1
the ram of consecration:2
Moreover four thousand were porters:1
Open rebuke is better than secret love:1
And why stand we in jeopardy every hour:1
the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching:1
who hath seen such things:1
I will praise thee with uprightness of heart:1
for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited:1
or his maid:4
Thy money perish with thee:1
an engraver:2
For he cometh in with vanity:1
For here have we no continuing city:1
Let all things be done unto edifying:1
not of this building:1
And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim:1
and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city:1
and then come and offer thy gift:1
an apostle of Jesus Christ:9
every precious stone was thy covering:1
I charge thee therefore before God:1
thou wast slain in thine high places:1
Naharai the Berothite:1
and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed:1
And Moses sware on that day:1
Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD:1
but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing:1
and I in them:1
and with astonishment:1
And he came by the Spirit into the temple:1
to whom the reproach of it was a burden:1
And the Jews:5
and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places:1
as he was with Moses:1
lest:313
and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD:1
he shall suffer loss:1
The mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight:1
And upon her forehead was a name written:1
Therefore their days did he consume in vanity:1
that the inheritance may be ours:1
and came out of him:1
they have also seduced Egypt:1
till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim:1
until I have consumed them by his hand:1
the one on this side of the bank of the river:1
and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders:1
and is become thine enemy:1
and gave other names unto the cities which they builded:1
that ye might possess their land:1
Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour:1
he is altogether lovely:1
nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity:1
and yet couldest not be satisfied:1
but the hurt:1
and cover you with skin:1
And it waxed great:1
and be thou laid with the uncircumcised:1
in Aruboth:1
and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire:1
through breaking the law dishonourest thou God:1
said Hushai:2
For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit:1
For God hath not given us the spirit of fear:1
whose cry is in the ships:1
Dominion and fear are with him:1
My meditation of him shall be sweet:1
and I laid meat unto them:1
Wherefore I will yet plead with you:1
And they smote all the cities round about Gerar:1
every one with his weapons:1
after they had stoned them with stones:1
that had the scarlet thread upon his hand:1
of Pua:2
Let mine outcasts dwell with thee:1
that dwelleth at thy right hand:1
Or a charmer:1
So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword:1
Awake up:1
until the waters were dried up from off the earth:1
and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem:2
And they took Joseph:1
she crieth upon the highest places of the city:1
and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite:1
I knew thee that thou art an hard man:1
hath God said:1
who then can behold him:1
for an house of defence to save me:1
but out of them all the Lord delivered me:1
Israel took not away the land of Moab:1
that he entered into a certain village:1
Sing unto him:3
but desire to have you circumcised:1
And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region:1
Hinder me not:1
and in all the villages thereof:1
and they prophesied likewise:1
but the spirit which is of God:1
as the LORD hath sworn to David:1
ask thy father:1
Nevertheless they shall be his servants:1
Say to them that are of a fearful heart:1
and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man:1
that we have sinned:1
he hath poured out his fierce anger:1
Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein:1
they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus:1
and Shelomith:3
and had a censer in his hand to burn incense:1
that it may minister grace unto the hearers:1
and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women:1
That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper:1
with a very great company:1
Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God:1
and go thou after them:1
that Christ must needs have suffered:1
and it shall be blessed for ever:1
heard of it:14
and out of the holy city:1
his loftiness:1
but suffer all things:1
for a man:18
Heresh:1
and dancing:4
he opened her womb:1
the tabret:1
and him that sat on it:1
that dwellest in the land of Uz:1
and ye know that our record is true:1
but when the desire cometh:1
the fear of the LORD:17
he hath set an harvest for thee:1
that the maker of his work trusteth therein:1
but had pleasure in unrighteousness:1
Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD hath put in my mouth:1
until he have executed:1
And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it:1
And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings:1
These are the inheritances:1
but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he:1
they fought with him:1
Behold now:18
have spoken:68
and from the possession of the city:1
accomplishing the service of God:1
upon the oxen:1
a people cometh from the north country:1
The pins of the tabernacle:1
and take a pledge of the poor:1
but unto God:2
and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram:1
I will go up to the land of unwalled villages:1
and there shall they see me:1
which is in the edge of the wilderness:1
I will give thee the worth of it in money:1
and no man shall buy you:1
and Zur:3
and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered:1
that I should be son in law to the king:1
not knowing the scriptures:1
or shall they be sold unto us:1
And when the hour was come:1
according to the measure of a man:1
Salute Apelles approved in Christ:1
And he told it to his father:1
four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof:1
And I will send the sword:1
Is not this the son of David:1
and one ram without blemish for peace offerings:1
which was at the side of the north gate:1
Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore:1
while she lieth desolate without them:1
Men and brethren:9
that teacheth all men every where against the people:1
have we prepared and sanctified:1
And the seven angels came out of the temple:1
Understand therefore:2
and the famine:6
that he fainted:1
and took their spoil:1
but he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding:1
thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations:1
but me it hateth:1
If we believe not:1
I builded me houses:1
And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps:1
that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp:1
so did he:6
They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind:1
and shall see no sorrow:1
shouldest mark iniquities:1
which is Christ in you:1
without blemish:46
which are of Israel:1
and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron:1
And they have built the high places of Tophet:1
then shall ye shout:1
by whom we have now received the atonement:1
Let all the nations be gathered together:1
And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus:1
thou art but a dead man:1
The ways of Zion do mourn:1
For neither at any time used we flattering words:1
that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:1
not in heart:2
be restored:4
and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon:1
I would to God:2
And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day:1
or any meat:1
He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord:1
Sing unto the LORD a new song:2
but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding:1
and his lips are the snare of his soul:1
through all the congregation:1
And while the day was coming on:1
nothing can be put to it:1
which is not according to the law:1
to give you an expected end:1
for the daughters will call me blessed:1
And when he thus had spoken:1
and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth:1
I will declare it unto you:1
and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign:1
that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared:1
be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace:1
to whom a number of men:1
Shimei:42
and your peace offerings:1
all the days of my appointed time will I wait:1
Take good heed therefore unto yourselves:1
to the house of the God of Jacob:2
be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse:1
but now have obtained mercy:1
And Abner said to Joab:1
she sat up:2
in all the wealth which God shall give Israel:1
and they shall dwell therein:1
and destruction shall be ready at his side:1
that the cloud filled the house of the LORD:1
Am I in God:1
rams:82
disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God:1
and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people:1
and I will bring them against thee on every side:1
To see thy power and thy glory:1
and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance:1
seven ears:3
make me to know mine end:1
Who will rise up for me against the evildoers:1
to make cakes to the queen of heaven:1
and of thy son:2
in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king:1
As for God:2
publish it not in the streets of Askelon:1
nor to your sorcerers:1
but after the Spirit:2
They be thy servant Jacob:1
and into the hands of the children of Ammon:1
but mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good:1
and for your food:1
that only may be done of you:1
Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the LORD:1
Follow peace with all men:1
Who cut up mallows by the bushes:1
I will profane my sanctuary:1
I have dreamed a dream:3
that I dwell in the tents of Kedar:1
commune with your own heart upon your bed:1
and cold and heat:1
and in the vessels thereof:1
and said in his heart:1
howbeit he would not go:1
if he be gotten into a city:1
Then Abner called to Joab:1
and declined neither to the right hand:1
and took him away in my wrath:1
and cast it away:2
And when he hath made her to drink the water:1
and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt:1
And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities:1
because they fainted:1
his leaf also shall not wither:1
and behaved himself wisely:1
his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances:1
and two hundred lambs:1
against the dwelling of the righteous:1
The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah:1
lest being present I should use sharpness:1
And when she could not longer hide him:1
And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger:1
That in blessing I will bless thee:1
For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity:1
and the glory of the Lord shone round about them:1
because of the people:3
And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman:1
as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar:1
And the kings of the earth:2
Of Ezra:1
All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people:1
for that thou hast comforted me:1
that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee:1
that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob:1
Mebunnai the Hushathite:1
And they went out into the fields:1
and as a watch in the night:1
And he spake of trees:1
they supposed it had been a spirit:1
nor speak lies:1
the heart of the wicked is little worth:1
and fell before David on her face:1
But ye say:3
From the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm trees made:1
and the rough ways shall be made smooth:1
but what:12
and mighty deeds:1
when the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion:1
and the sheep follow him:1
and they return to Egypt:1
They know not:1
but condescend to men of low estate:1
and it is known that it is man:1
he shall cry:1
This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation:1
the half was not told me:1
when I looked that it should bring forth grapes:1
and he hath set darkness in my paths:1
who of God is made unto us wisdom:1
but they went about to slay him:1
and discomfited them:4
and lead thy captivity captive:1
a great altar to see to:1
Delivering thee from the people:1
Then Jeremiah said unto all the people:1
Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel:1
and cursed:11
and passing through he preached in all the cities:1
And the sons of Ezra were:1
The meek shall eat and be satisfied:1
there was not one city too strong for us:1
If iniquity be in thine hand:1
but as thou wilt:1
for thou hast gone and made thee other gods:1
he said unto Simon:1
These are the four spirits of the heavens:1
stablish:139
And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up:1
and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup:1
he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel:1
the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee:1
and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt:1
partakers of the benefit:1
But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:1
and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean:1
when they heard these things:2
I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king:1
and not to leave the other undone:2
And we said:4
s seed in Edom:1
Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world:1
I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once:1
and the fig tree:2
but for the Lord:1
and threw stones at him:1
There shall no evil befall thee:1
And he answered me and said:1
for thy mercy:1
But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you:1
the second to Jedaiah:1
if the plague have not changed his colour:1
an hundred forty and eight:1
and a cubit and a half the height thereof:3
And when these days were expired:1
let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord:1
he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men:1
that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:1
and set me upon my feet:2
and as the Father gave me commandment:1
and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son:1
the vessels of the LORD:4
And they took Absalom:1
except the law had said:1
and behold our desolations:1
Neither from a stranger:1
Then came they:1
In that day also he shall come even to thee from Assyria:1
speak unto the king:3
Whereunto I am ordained a preacher:1
and be not afraid:2
lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen:1
The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha:1
and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul:1
and shall take of the blood of the bullock:1
some of the watch came into the city:1
Thou answeredst them:1
They shall make known unto you all things which are done here:1
but to do good they have no knowledge:1
and they shall search thine house:1
even the pestilence:1
charming never so wisely:1
her children are gone into captivity before the enemy:1
that I kept silence:1
Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest:1
Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day:1
What is it therefore:1
and all his chariots:2
when I know your state:1
Then they that gladly received his word were baptized:1
for my head is filled with dew:1
And Moses went out:4
And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:1
and put them in the common prison:1
Ye shall know them by their fruits:1
waiting for the adoption:1
and for that which is baked in the pan:1
and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt:1
Hanani:40
but he that goeth out:1
whether it be a male or female:1
which they received of the hand of the Levites:1
which came into Egypt:3
And he went up thence to Penuel:1
and thy gold:3
and will cover the earth:1
for out of it wast thou taken:1
Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire:1
through the midst of Jerusalem:1
But whom say ye that I am:3
the children of Nephusim:1
They have no wine:1
Defile the house:1
And the LORD spake unto Gad:1
he is the son of Jehoshaphat:1
Jeremias:1
being about threescore and two years old:1
and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari:1
and make a prey of thy merchandise:1
And he went in unto Hagar:1
Wherefore rebuke them sharply:1
And the children of Sheshan:1
that I may come and worship him also:1
which thou didst give unto them:1
and bare our sicknesses:1
a sower went forth to sow:1
And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah:1
and because he had no pity:1
and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem:1
And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply:1
that shall cause him to wander:1
am holy:7
They shall not dwell in thy land:1
Hast thou considered my servant Job:2
But if the owner thereof be with it:1
yet he liveth by the power of God:1
and to the remnant of the people:1
there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:1
that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth:1
Do this now:1
and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand:1
so that she conceived:1
and in his hand a sharp sickle:1
which I commanded them to do:1
and offered it according to the manner:1
Wherefore comfort one another with these words:1
But if any widow have children or nephews:1
and the sockets of the vail:1
and offered it for a burnt offering wholly unto the LORD:1
And I will come down and talk with thee there:1
and departed into Egypt:1
for a son:1
in perils in the city:1
from the border unto the east sea:1
But his wife said unto him:1
I go out from thee:1
and unto the beasts of the earth:1
if so be that God will think upon us:1
and thy teachers have transgressed against me:1
and trembled:4
Beside their genealogy of males:1
and the mountains shall be thrown down:1
why smitest thou me:1
and thirty daughters:1
nor yet riches to men of understanding:1
but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it:1
There is no common bread under mine hand:1
and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers:1
let us go:27
When they that fed them saw what was done:1
and took:149
Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan:1
Who is on the LORD:1
the dart:1
All that the Father giveth me shall come to me:1
but the word of the oath:1
The elders which are among you I exhort:1
I will tarry until thou come again:1
but privately to them which were of reputation:1
if it be a male:1
have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law:1
Then said they:16
he hath despised the cities:1
The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim:1
And they shall be upon Aaron:1
And he delivered him to his mother:1
for whose cause this evil is upon us:2
neither shall men lament for them:1
Ye must be born again:1
and accuse this man:1
And I give unto them eternal life:1
and Bealoth:1
And the sons of Benjamin were Belah:1
from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name:1
But those things:2
from doing thy pleasure on my holy day:1
Iddo:14
and set him in the midst of them:2
and he shall have no name in the street:1
And he looked round about on them which sat about him:1
Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah:1
After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem:1
Let us rise up and build:1
and the world heareth them:1
And the people saw them departing:1
and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God:2
Then the Egyptians shall hear it:1
Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree:1
that they turn not again to cover the earth:1
though thou wouldest needs be gone:1
and the cup was found in Benjamin:1
And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver:1
And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel:1
both for the children of Israel:1
and in houses which no man inhabiteth:1
but the folly of fools is deceit:1
A new commandment I give unto you:1
let down from heaven by four corners:1
and blood into her streets:1
This Moses whom they refused:1
And when they heard these sayings:1
And if the latter husband hate her:1
nor rejected:1
this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria:1
and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:1
And he led them on safely:1
that I may take comfort a little:1
he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city:1
For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous:1
and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever:1
And Judah came to Gilgal:1
That he should still live for ever:1
Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord:1
the fourteenth to Jeshebeab:1
nor possess the land:1
Helkai:1
that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:1
Sing with gladness for Jacob:1
and eat of the bread:1
that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it:1
and in purple:3
all the Egyptians came unto Joseph:1
than he that is perverse in his ways:1
to practise hypocrisy:1
and she was a widow:1
when she had pierced and stricken through his temples:1
but a man of understanding walketh uprightly:1
which was the son of Booz:1
and all Bethshean:1
And the priest shall bring her near:1
this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people:1
or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above:2
we have wronged no man:1
O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave:1
so it became one tabernacle:1
For the king trusteth in the LORD:1
And Joab answered and said:1
So when they had further threatened them:1
they are utterly consumed with terrors:1
Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward:1
they shall not rise:2
When I said:1
He that is of God heareth God:1
even every man upon his son:1
on the two ends of the mercy seat:1
why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel:1
For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel:1
and sanctified Aaron:1
Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle:1
That which hath been is now:1
And he shall offer his offering unto the LORD:1
to the beds of spices:1
and it was written in the book:2
I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly:1
My lord the king:2
And his servants said to him:1
yet an adulteress:1
And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army:1
a prey of divers colours of needlework:1
and thy cry hath filled the land:1
and they were dispersed through the countries:1
and the colt:1
and the thing was not known:1
and from his people:2
lying in the field:1
And afterward when David heard it:1
And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains:1
that ye might believe:3
even unto Azzah:1
Shew me a token for good:1
let him do the kinsman:1
what of the night:2
and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit:1
forbear thee from meddling with God:1
Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron:1
and a time to heal:1
forty days and forty nights:11
But I tell you of a truth:2
fear ye not:4
but I said:1
and all our cattle:1
the LORD will cast her out:1
Blessed be he of the LORD:1
and on them that are out of the way:1
And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness:1
A bekah for every man:1
and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was:1
But love ye your enemies:1
return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus:1
and all the sons likewise of king David:1
and the people that were with him were about six hundred men:1
for I know that ye have much cattle:1
Neither shall ye profane my holy name:1
What do ye:3
The son of Zerahiah:1
I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest:2
who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom:1
and let her stand before the king:1
captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh:1
The sons of Kohath:2
And spake kindly unto him:1
Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father:1
shall there be evil in a city:1
and the fat:42
much less for a servant to have rule over princes:1
and he hath set the world upon them:1
In the LORD put I my trust:1
And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse:1
and sheep abundantly:1
and they would not come:1
Thy borders are in the midst of the seas:1
and it shall be thy part:1
nor ye also:1
and ye be a great multitude:1
even as a father the son in whom he delighteth:1
which had divers colours:1
if any man hear my voice:1
dig now in the wall:1
And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee:1
and scourges in your sides:1
and have not set thee before them:1
and all that are round about her:1
every one of them:17
the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children:1
and let us go to Gilgal:1
and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all that thou doest:1
then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows:1
For he is cast into a net by his own feet:1
or thirsty:1
and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons:1
The sons:64
the kings shall shut their mouths at him:1
When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan:1
and made mine heritage an abomination:1
and all his chariots with him:1
and pots:1
and gavest them into their hands:1
therefore she called his name Judah:1
and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted:1
that we should go unto the heathen:1
that thine ox and thine ass may rest:1
I looked upon it:1
Praise God in his sanctuary:1
and not from the beginning:1
and not evil:2
And the LORD set a mark upon Cain:1
stand in the holy place:2
where Lazarus was:1
his kingdom shall be broken:1
and I will there talk with thee:1
and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death:1
believe the works:1
and had made ready for the building:1
and that nation:1
why then call ye me Naomi:1
In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings:1
to my holy mountain Jerusalem:1
and offer it upon the altar:1
The LORD hath made known his salvation:1
shall be as a dream of a night vision:1
while she was with them:1
and the oxen:4
So he arose from the earth:1
let the earth rejoice:2
Yet hear the word of the LORD:2
And they were astonished with a great astonishment:1
And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen:1
And if a man smite the eye of his servant:1
Be strong and courageous:1
were not with Adonijah:1
When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob:1
and brake the pitchers that were in their hands:1
for they dealt perversely with me without a cause:1
which art a merchant of the people for many isles:1
and men of war fit for the battle:1
and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields:1
It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction:1
According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness:1
The LORD be between me and thee:1
And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers:1
and caused waters to run down like rivers:1
though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary:1
Wash thyself therefore:1
That I may see the good of thy chosen:1
And God spake unto Moses:1
And David took the crown of their king from off his head:1
but shalt be drawn away:1
These waters issue out toward the east country:1
and he did eat:6
I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation:1
and submit yourselves:1
in the province of Babylon:2
nor to usurp authority over the man:1
to make empty the soul of the hungry:1
And the sons of Helah were:1
whether it be done against a nation:1
But if ye refuse and rebel:1
therefore the name of the same place was called:1
Praise him:5
Malluch:6
a day of wasteness and desolation:1
as God had commanded Noah:1
unto every fenced city:1
Of the sons also of Adin:1
how is she become as a widow:1
and trouble it:1
Neither go into the town:1
But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn:1
and it shall devour every green tree in thee:1
But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him:1
They were amazed:1
thou shalt not go over the boughs again:1
And the waters prevailed:3
it shall vanish away:1
Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came:1
the king is held in the galleries:1
he is my defence:2
and overlaid them with brass:1
s seat is:1
And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab:1
nor rend his clothes:1
answered and said to the king:1
but some are fallen asleep:1
for a statute for ever:1
but now much more diligent:1
and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground:1
and every herb of the field before it grew:1
Hang him thereon:1
s voice is known by multitude of words:1
and in their streets:1
and all the kings of the Canaanites:1
that is over against Egypt:1
And hath redeemed us from our enemies:1
and they said thus unto it:1
And thou shalt make an altar of shittim wood:1
And they departed from Rithmah:1
so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel:1
an offering of memorial:1
and thou shalt cast five sockets of brass for them:1
not doing thine own ways:1
He clave the rocks in the wilderness:1
and not put on two coats:1
And the Philistines came up yet again:1
that wrought all the work of the sanctuary:1
And the sons of Gomer:2
if it were possible for him:1
then I could have borne it:1
he is judged of all:1
and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven:1
And they shall divide it into seven parts:1
and chief of the priests:1
Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days:1
Did I fear a great multitude:1
two sockets under one board:5
All that cometh is vanity:1
It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy:1
For he shall give his angels charge over thee:1
And have no root in themselves:1
and Kirjatharba:2
it had a wall round about:1
as though God did beseech you by us:1
And Moses hid his face:1
And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day:1
One generation shall praise thy works to another:1
For who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD:1
And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work:1
apostles:64
and I will be quiet:1
and an helmet of salvation upon his head:1
and beautiful crowns upon their heads:1
in Heshbon:8
that he may declare it:1
Though I should die with thee:1
and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed:1
by the place of the ashes:1
and they shall kindle in them:1
But he answered and said unto them:2
and Mizzah:2
And the people repented them for Benjamin:1
and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him:2
and wilt do that which is right in his sight:1
Now when she saw that she had waited:1
which is to say:2
Be of good courage:4
There will be heat:1
he came to the house of Mary the mother of John:1
The king said moreover to Shimei:1
And the children of Israel:66
and his stink shall come up:1
Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue:1
or any unclean beast:1
And the people stood afar off:1
nor my brethren:1
One is so near to another:1
And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead:1
How many hired servants of my father:1
to make any manner of cunning work:1
by a statute for ever from the children of Israel:1
But David tarried still at Jerusalem:1
and pilled white strakes in them:1
but the dead is thy son:1
and of the possession of the city:2
wherewith they minister unto it:1
and I shall be destroyed:1
James the son of Alphaeus:4
And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark:1
and peace:45
with cherubims of cunning work made he them:1
If a man have two wives:1
After two days was the feast of the passover:1
which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see:1
Igal the son of Joseph:1
which ye have profaned among the heathen:1
in the ninth day of the month:2
which hadst cast us off:1
in thine anger cast down the people:1
Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them:1
If thou buy an Hebrew servant:1
for the LORD is good:2
that we will say unto them:1
The son of Hesed:1
and after many days shall they be visited:1
The sword of Goliath the Philistine:1
And there was no bread in all the land:1
Weep ye not for the dead:1
he will cut me off with pining sickness:1
I say unto you:123
and ordain elders in every city:1
they shall fall by the sword:4
and stood over the cherubims:1
and when they had gathered the multitude together:1
Grant that these my two sons may sit:1
and he had a name written:1
and saw the land:1
and raise up seed unto his brother:3
and will utterly destroy them:1
and God repented of the evil:1
not that I had ought to accuse my nation of:1
that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen:1
thou changest his countenance:1
and they rode upon the camels:1
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven:2
they are cruel:2
and the people returned from pursuing after Israel:1
an house not made with hands:1
yet had he no wages:1
two thousand fifty and six:1
and he with the twelfth:1
and Bunah:1
none shall want her mate:1
Take us the foxes:1
For God shall cast upon him:1
the waters stood above the mountains:1
This chamber:1
as he that feareth an oath:1
but ye see me:1
who liveth for ever and ever:2
If I expressly say unto the lad:1
But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself:1
trusting in the LORD:1
and the plague brake in upon them:1
he rebuked Peter:1
and his name was Laban:1
And they brought unto him also infants:1
and the priests took up the ark:2
we shall be saved by his life:1
and stood upon the Philistine:1
for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day:1
that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not:1
in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied:1
Ha:687
for I have rebelled against his commandment:1
that they rise not again:1
but the gate shall not be shut until the evening:1
Even they sent:1
and put a space betwixt drove and drove:1
thou filledst many people:1
and gave them to eat and to drink:1
Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee:1
And the king sware unto him:1
For he longed after you all:1
were fifty and three thousand and four hundred:3
and he caused me to eat that roll:1
Being filled with the fruits of righteousness:1
And when he was come into the temple:1
but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel:1
and he judged Israel:3
Where is God my maker:1
but whom the Lord commendeth:1
the sons of one man in the land of Canaan:1
that ye may learn them:1
say unto the cities of Judah:1
Pilate then went out unto them:1
when ye came out of Egypt:2
which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it:2
I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:1
and make an atonement for her:1
And God opened her eyes:1
my great army which I sent among you:1
Hoglah:4
whereof we are glad:1
thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways:1
be lord over thy brethren:1
the Hivite:23
and all Cinneroth:1
neither shall he prolong his days:1
a man of great stature:3
Now in the morning as he returned into the city:1
and Sheal:1
and came into the land of Israel:1
Which knew me from the beginning:1
for unto thee am I now sent:1
Then the men of the city said unto Joash:1
six hundred twenty and three:1
Lift up your heads:2
Henceforth I call you not servants:1
this same shall reign over my people:1
and a comely person:1
and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen:1
Of the sons of Phinehas:1
hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor:1
and of the corn:1
and the plain shall be destroyed:1
And the LORD saith:1
which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand:1
which we found in our sacks:1
Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God:1
And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel:1
Take heed to yourselves:4
And king David said:2
according to the commandment of the king:2
and received him joyfully:1
the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple:1
O ye of little faith:4
Now also when I am old and greyheaded:1
On the eighth day offered Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur:1
Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people:1
he turneth his hand against me all the day:1
and all his host:1
and the Word was God:1
The sons of Isaac:1
yet shall he live:1
Not as Cain:1
If ye can break my covenant of the day:1
I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer:1
who trusted in God:1
or drink:17
which dwell solitarily in the wood:1
and whose covenant he brake:1
and heal his son:1
on every side:32
every one of you hath a psalm:1
his wonders among all people:1
and take up his cross daily:1
Is not this he that sat and begged:1
The LORD shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face:1
and none spake a word unto him:1
s baptism:2
that they said:4
thy throne from generation to generation:1
Hamath:29
the children of Sophereth:2
that put bitter for sweet:1
And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty:1
Because they despised my judgments:1
which gave testimony unto the word of his grace:1
The Lord hath need of him:1
ye that forget God:1
and he was afflicted:1
The LORD hath broken the staff of the wicked:1
Peradventure ye dwell among us:1
For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this:1
and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again:1
A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it:1
concerning this:15
and fasted until even:1
I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way:1
even of that which is for Aaron:1
and all the vessels thereof:8
Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne:1
for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God:2
and fasted:8
And the first born bare a son:1
I have of mine own proper good:1
And what nation is there so great:1
my heart trusted in him:1
What sign shewest thou unto us:1
and the people fled from the Philistines:1
And of Benjamin he said:1
I leave the world:1
son in law:12
duke Pinon:2
shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols:1
and sprinkle it upon the tent:1
And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him:1
When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit:1
neither have ye brought again that which was driven away:1
thou didst hide thy face:1
and the horns of the altar shall be cut off:1
O my lord:5
who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel:1
Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered:1
as a servant:2
I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life:1
Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee:1
Doest thou well to be angry:2
And there arose a great storm of wind:1
under the springs of Pisgah:1
and in the power of his might:1
and he was very angry:1
And Joab the son of Zeruiah:3
And ye say:1
We be come from a far country:1
The LORD is in his holy temple:1
and the hanging for the court gate:1
I die:17
and for them by themselves:1
I will see what their end shall be:1
the top thereof:2
And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem:1
and I put the earring upon her face:1
and they receive you:2
Hast thou given the horse strength:1
but Silas and Timotheus abode there still:1
but now murderers:1
And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship:1
Judah shall go up first:1
and have not heard them:2
And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the LORD:1
David sware:4
To declare:2
In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities:1
and shall do against any of them:1
And I turned:4
Say unto thy brethren:1
or who hath opened his eyes:1
Zalmon the Ahohite:1
and do even so to Mordecai the Jew:1
and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god:1
that I might know the proof of you:1
then my strength will go from me:1
eleven cities with their villages:1
and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof:1
for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us:1
even with the princes of his people:1
and in vessels of stone:1
among whom was Mary Magdalene:1
I said unto the fools:1
And if he come to see me:1
And the LORD hath done to him:1
and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met:1
which is in Gibeon:2
And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines:1
Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge:1
whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen:1
And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines:1
Is it not written in your law:1
Over against the border shall the rings be for places of the staves to bear the table:1
Whom say the people that I am:1
therefore he smote Israel:1
the children of Israel lifted up their eyes:1
The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips:1
Where is it:1
from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered:1
Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all the day:1
he that offereth an oblation:1
before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison:1
let him die the death:2
upon the harp with a solemn sound:1
and also:68
And of the last sons of Adonikam:1
And Zadok the priest:3
ruler against ruler:1
But withal prepare me also a lodging:1
but for the LORD:2
drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah:1
and Shual:1
and when the father of the damsel saw him:1
and destroyeth them:1
eyes within thy locks:1
when they were come down:3
I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth:1
Wherefore Joab departed:1
Therefore at that time:1
to make ready for him:1
neither are they plagued like other men:1
shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits:1
and looking back:1
Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites:1
and all the princes of the congregation:1
For death is come up into our windows:1
Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God:1
And as David and his men went by the way:1
he and all the men of Israel with him:1
with the breaking of thy loins:1
s daughter loved David:1
and upon the south of Caleb:1
Consider mine affliction:1
but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean:1
And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh:1
The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar:1
but now commandeth all men every where to repent:1
and what is the length thereof:1
for thou hast a little strength:1
These are the journeys of the children of Israel:1
whole Palestina:2
these are parts of his ways:1
and let him appoint officers over the land:1
Even as Sodom and Gomorrha:1
where Ahiman:1
And Israel said:6
For many deceivers are entered into the world:1
because ye have sinned against the LORD:2
and the Kenizzites:1
she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she:1
And he gave him the covenant of circumcision:1
and fall upon us:2
According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous things:1
failed:12
And the same day:2
and they rejoiced with her:1
but live according to God in the spirit:1
And Shallum begat Jekamiah:1
or cities:1
so it was a very great trembling:1
and as he was destroying:1
and the length is as large as the breadth:1
the earth melted:1
And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD:1
I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon:1
and took the doors of the gate of the city:1
nor by letter as from us:1
and cast a mount against it:1
and be cut down:1
and his device that he had devised against the Jews:1
and shall inherit everlasting life:1
Sallu the son of Meshullam:2
Then the prophets:1
and cut them in the head:1
in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them:1
He shall be great:1
Whither will he go:1
Rejoice evermore:1
and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them:1
when Abram was come into Egypt:1
And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man:1
For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid:1
I should have been carried from the womb to the grave:1
and five changes of raiment:1
and none escaped:1
and the valley:6
the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses:1
And when it was evening:1
Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah:1
ye shall keep it in his appointed season:1
prophesy and say unto Gog:1
the Jews took counsel to kill him:1
and upon his bands:1
two thousand eight hundred and twelve:1
And Eleazar died:1
Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift:1
And the sons of Jerahmeel the firstborn of Hezron were:1
and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat:1
whom he had used as his friend:1
and my good fruit:1
s burdens:1
when they have heard:3
This is the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their families:1
and what is mine end:1
the unclean shall not pass over it:1
and took hold of it:1
and I will stretch out mine hand against thee:1
and saw a beast rise up out of the sea:1
and thou shalt be above only:1
I shall go to him:1
And their father gave them great gifts of silver:1
and gave them to the founder:1
may be required of this generation:1
The men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round about:1
but they sent to Lachish after him:1
by whose stripes ye were healed:1
thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice:1
could not speak unto you as unto spiritual:1
then shall mine enemies turn back:1
and Potiphar:1
the glory of the LORD shall be thy rereward:1
And there was a certain disciple at Damascus:1
And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron:1
and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper:1
be with me where I am:1
they were thy merchants:3
each prince on his day:1
So Obadiah went to meet Ahab:1
And if thy brother:4
Oh that my people had hearkened unto me:1
And the priest shall look upon the plague:1
What doest thou:6
ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up:1
and sent them away by night:1
For if that first covenant had been faultless:1
Now he was riding upon his ass:1
And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet:1
Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities:1
How long shall I see the standard:1
and lamented him:2
for the corn which they bought:1
they are full of children:1
For this is the will of God:1
The two families which the LORD hath chosen:1
and meddleth with strife belonging not to him:1
because it is bitter:1
And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead:1
and bring again that which was driven away:1
and upon which never came yoke:1
but be ye all ready:1
But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel:1
Not by works of righteousness which we have done:1
and he hath sent him away:1
and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple:1
this shall be the portion of their cup:1
the son of Saul:9
to whom shall we go:1
And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand:1
except it be for fornication:1
and every man to his neighbour:1
who clothed you in scarlet:1
being condemned of himself:1
through a land of deserts and of pits:1
Put me:2
And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even:1
It is sown in dishonour:1
Pithom and Raamses:1
I will hear thee:1
the father of all the children of Eber:1
altars shall be unto him to sin:1
The slothful man saith:2
he shall not spare:2
I know that ye all:1
and the child was cured from that very hour:1
and he shall be a priest upon his throne:1
that fight against mount Zion:1
as my lord saith:1
and to the cities of Judah:1
Take a psalm:1
and they rested on the house with timber of cedar:1
wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people:1
and whose sins are covered:1
till iniquity was found in thee:1
and he shall destroy thy strong holds:1
He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh:1
And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead:1
and we all do fade as a leaf:1
And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon:1
and they washed his armour:1
and they received the Holy Ghost:1
And as Samuel turned about to go away:1
The just LORD is in the midst thereof:1
for the ships were broken at Eziongeber:1
ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD seven days:2
the son of my vows:1
And the chief priests took the silver pieces:1
And they took every man his censer:1
a Bethlehemite:1
neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth:1
He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man:1
And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan:1
With the work of an engraver in stone:1
But he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive:1
which we have sinned against thee:1
and guide me:1
One board had two tenons:1
For this:55
he was strengthened:1
and anointed them:2
For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem:1
these are that Moses and Aaron:1
his pillars:5
be glad and rejoice:7
For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity:1
will he regard your persons:1
and in nakedness:1
and cried through the lattice:1
Then said Samuel:3
The earth is the LORD:1
Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla:1
kings of Judah:23
then shall I know that ye are no spies:1
By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt:1
and forbid them not:3
and go thou in:1
and became his wife:1
which love to go in long clothing:1
for the LORD thy God:8
fell on sleep:1
because there was no room for them in the inn:1
And this I pray:1
s sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about:1
and beat him before the judgment seat:1
even unto the water gate eastward:1
that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee:1
and for the tithes:1
Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever:1
and Leah went out to meet him:1
and the glory of Moab shall be contemned:1
And when the messengers were come in:1
and judged Israel in all those places:1
but as unto carnal:1
how much more then the hearts of the children of men:1
for there be more with us than with him:1
Come in:4
because of the LORD:5
and his body was wet with the dew of heaven:2
Ammi:37
The land also shall be left of them:1
And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice:1
that while he executed the priest:1
and brought the sea upon them:1
So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness:1
which I have vowed unto the LORD:1
and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it:1
and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God:1
and stand up for mine help:1
and have bent their bow:1
Where is he:6
And when he was come near unto her:1
For if any be a hearer of the word:1
which hast made heaven:1
What will this babbler say:1
And he was in the hinder part of the ship:1
So the woman went her way:1
and Mishael:1
I wait for the LORD:1
of the family of Elimelech:1
and have respect unto thy ways:1
lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God:1
And the elders of Jabesh said unto him:1
I hate robbery for burnt offering:1
Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss:1
for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off:1
it may be that the LORD will work for us:1
wives:136
Ahijah the Pelonite:1
thy spirit is good:1
Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter:1
for all the signs which I have shewed among them:1
for he knew not that she was his daughter in law:1
flowing with milk and honey:8
and turned tail to tail:1
Because ye believed me not:1
whither we flee for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria:1
and shall offer his sin offering:1
it is not good to marry:1
that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel:1
for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:1
Take thou also unto thee principal spices:1
who hast given me wisdom and might:1
the sons of Jeroham of Gedor:1
But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving:1
and the holy garments for Aaron the priest:2
we stumble at noon day as in the night:1
he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor:1
working with his hands the thing which is good:1
So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned:1
and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein:1
Ye shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning:1
If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son:1
and hear the sound of the trumpet:1
and we will come unto him:1
and shutteth:3
I know not what thou sayest:2
His blood be on us:1
and our eyelids gush out with waters:1
therefore they called it the city of David:1
and your posterity with fishhooks:1
And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife:1
thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass:1
in which are some things hard to be understood:1
thou art made whole:1
and crieth out in her pangs:1
and they let down Jeremiah with cords:1
Above when he said:1
Ahihud the son of Shelomi:1
even for him:1
The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion:1
and let them shave all their flesh:1
and in fury:2
was able to open the book:1
neither carest thou for any man:1
This know also:1
but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their LORD:1
Be thou exalted:4
and I will be his God:1
And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword:1
that there was no breath left in him:1
and write fourscore:1
as by one man sin entered into the world:1
to cast down the poor and needy:1
neither had any man known her:1
and break down their images:1
Of the sons of Kohath:1
all of them dwelling without walls:1
hear thou from thy dwelling place:1
and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel:1
And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them:1
if any fellowship of the Spirit:1
I bare the loss of it:1
but doting about questions and strifes of words:1
And he came apace:1
And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day:1
Shew yourselves:1
when he had privily called the wise men:1
they were more ruddy in body than rubies:1
And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood:1
that I shall do unto you:2
And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting:1
Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken:1
for the fruitful vine:1
that hath done for thee these great and terrible things:1
that ye sold me hither:1
and dwelt in Tirzah:1
And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes:1
with all that great multitude:1
cried:190
even ten commandments:1
that at what time the chest was brought unto the king:1
of them shall ye buy:2
And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues:1
And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature:1
As the LORD of hosts liveth:1
a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ:1
But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification:1
For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name:1
how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath:1
be sold unto thee:2
and the hollow of Jacob:1
And as he entered into a certain village:1
See now that I:1
that she rose up hastily and went out:1
for they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim:1
and lay down naked all that day and all that night:1
ye are fallen from grace:1
let him eat at home:1
and blindness:1
So they look up Jonah:1
and unto the gate of his place:1
or any beast:1
Art thou Elias:1
being twelve men:1
And as he did so year by year:1
and they shall flee far off:1
And the king said unto them:2
neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your land:1
And Salah lived thirty years:1
neither have we vineyard:1
for I have found my sheep which was lost:1
but that ye are true men:1
and she was his only child:1
Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites:1
and because his works have been to thee-ward very good:1
the son of Malluch:1
the lead is consumed of the fire:1
and make crowns:1
and the power of darkness:1
and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them:1
And forgive us our debts:1
and the children of Israel stoned him with stones:1
an holy portion of the land:1
remember the LORD afar off:1
Eli:310
and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side:2
Righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way:1
Why dost thou strive against him:1
ye might say unto this sycamine tree:1
Raca:1
and that which covereth the inwards:1
and sat with the servants:1
The burden of Damascus:1
and all the coasts of Palestine:1
Then the priest shall consider:1
and before the princes:3
and the third part of the stars:1
which shall be for their destruction:1
Then when lust hath conceived:1
for a burnt sacrifice:1
John did no miracle:1
and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life:1
whether there be wood therein:1
I will make waste mountains and hills:1
and take them by violence:1
and worketh willingly with her hands:1
and Joses:3
but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously:1
the God which fed me all my life long unto this day:1
as it were a day:2
they go down again to the depths:1
Ye have killed the people of the LORD:1
and all that was good:1
yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters:1
s virginity:2
Crucify him:4
Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family:1
and iniquity stoppeth her mouth:1
Also that day they offered great sacrifices:1
he may redeem himself:1
and in the name of our God we will set up our banners:1
Moreover:140
because he was righteous in his own eyes:1
a Netophathite:1
it was the latter growth after the king:1
though he sought it carefully with tears:1
as if that were a very little thing:1
and ye believed him not:2
Six days ye shall gather it:1
And who is my neighbour:1
but I will add thereto:1
And two turtledoves:1
And when he would not be persuaded:1
which the Father hath put in his own power:1
But they thought to do me mischief:1
and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon:1
and shall howl for vexation of spirit:1
The wicked borroweth:1
one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses:1
He will deliver his soul from going into the pit:1
that I may prove them:1
Thou shalt seek them:1
Strangers shall fade away:1
So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed:1
And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod:1
ye Levites:1
and have comforted myself:1
and it shall be holy unto you:1
having a servant plowing or feeding cattle:1
and when they fall upon the sword:1
but thou and thy father:1
for thy land:1
vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold:1
and the priests shall be astonished:1
And Cain was very wroth:1
and I burn not:1
and twenty rams:1
for the LORD is with thee:1
but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness:1
that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David:1
And if any man will hurt them:1
It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword:1
for he hath prepared for them a city:1
nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up:2
neither was there ought missing unto them:1
and the king thereof:5
deliver him only:1
I cannot dig:1
after that the king had burned the roll:1
I am resolved what to do:1
A man void of understanding striketh hands:1
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it:1
where the whore sitteth:1
because our testimony among you was believed:1
and so will I keep myself:1
For he shall be like the heath in the desert:1
We be not born of fornication:1
Praise ye the name of the LORD:1
which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen:1
In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me:1
and when thou risest up:2
so that men could not touch their garments:1
he also will hear their cry:1
and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt:1
for thy sons are taken captives:1
what is mine iniquity:1
which his right hand had purchased:1
The word which God sent unto the children of Israel:1
Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee:1
And he is before all things:1
thou shalt not know from whence it riseth:1
Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own:1
the prophets say unto them:1
nor cause his voice to be heard in the street:1
and the other cherub on the other end:1
Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath:1
it saith to them who are under the law:1
Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings:1
and of all the increase of the field:1
The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do:1
out of the place where the priests:1
and lay them down in their dens:1
And the arches round about were five and twenty cubits long:1
and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea:1
What shall I say:1
But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb:1
expert in war:4
And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it:1
it is but a scab:1
I will make darkness light before them:1
Go therefore now:1
She obeyed not the voice:1
and as driven stubble to his bow:1
to search the city:1
nor crying:1
And they turned aside to fight against him:1
Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth:1
then I will not go:1
a day of trouble and distress:1
Of the tribe of Judah:2
and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way:1
be made for all men:1
it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon:1
Jechonias begat Salathiel:1
they were scorched:1
and to be bakers:1
and his spring shall become dry:1
Or darkness:1
And they set the altar upon his bases:1
and went on his way:1
and weakeneth the strength of the mighty:1
but the end shall not be yet:1
neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits:1
take up the cross:1
all are come to pass unto you:1
and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah:1
speaking evil of you:1
and Shoco:1
for ye have received your consolation:1
and the fire ran along upon the ground:1
and led him unto Pilate:1
And there was not left a man of them:1
And Jacob said:13
And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon:1
The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD:1
And landing at Syracuse:1
whether it be a woollen garment:1
and sorrow of mind:1
I am weary to bear them:1
and begat Uzza:1
And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon:1
And now come I to thee:1
hath spoiled by violence:2
they were all with one accord in one place:1
and it grew up together with him:1
Thou shalt bring them in:1
before I go hence:1
to bring us in unto this evil place:1
and no man regarded:1
and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years:1
The princes of Judah:2
he heard my voice out of his temple:1
And thou shalt put them into one basket:1
Naphtali is a hind let loose:1
they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully:1
Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee:1
and followed Abimelech:1
For those priests were made without an oath:1
Mahlah:4
Go up into Gilead:1
nor to the rest that did the work:1
and Hushim:1
He weakened my strength in the way:1
and carried away my daughters:1
And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king:1
I will love them no more:1
The full soul loatheth an honeycomb:1
And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten:1
And that:53
O mighty man:1
And this I speak for your own profit:1
and at Bethbirei:1
Shem was an hundred years old:1
And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh:1
and thou shalt come to Babylon:1
stubble:18
but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee:1
in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell:1
and Moses put the vail upon his face again:1
but served God with fastings and prayers night and day:1
and of his fruitful field:1
That this may be a sign among you:1
Be sober:1
who was sold for a servant:1
named Abiathar:1
And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years:1
And he turned aside:2
and ye shall be slain before your enemies:1
and my father:3
and them that are in Laodicea:1
and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood:1
so shalt thou dwell in the land:1
nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child:1
for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee:1
and blessed be he that blesseth thee:1
speaking things which they ought not:1
and the altar of the burnt offering:1
and to perish:1
and he called his name JESUS:1
a Gileadite:1
and that their kings may be brought:1
I delight to do thy will:1
speak evil of the things that they understand not:1
and for my gold:1
Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood according to these judgments:1
that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people:1
the house of the tabernacle:1
lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice:1
Surely the princes of Zoan are fools:1
I cannot attain unto it:1
and healed them that had need of healing:1
shew me wherefore thou contendest with me:1
that it may be there for a witness against thee:1
But it was thou:1
and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead:1
Wherefore the king said unto me:1
The fool hath said in his heart:2
and holiness:2
the Cretians are alway liars:1
and Huppim:2
To whom we gave place by subjection:1
and the name of his wife Abigail:1
and he shall pay as the judges determine:1
Remember this day:1
for he giveth God thanks:1
And the LORD God said unto the serpent:1
and thy breasts to clusters of grapes:1
The LORD our righteousness:1
s daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her:1
and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped:1
the Spirit of truth:3
This is the thing that ye shall do:1
his disciples were with him:1
How can a man be born when he is old:1
and they were glad:1
as stuff for removing:1
Azzur:1
And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day:1
and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river:1
And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts:1
For the LORD will not cast off for ever:1
They that make a graven image are all of them vanity:1
that he might redeem us from all iniquity:1
and the victory:1
for she was afraid:1
and overlaid the bars with gold:1
there they stood:1
He winketh with his eyes:1
and thou shalt cleanse the altar:1
thou shalt see greater things than these:1
out of whom the devils were departed:2
There is no darkness:1
happy shalt thou be:1
And the servant said unto him:1
and the maid arose:1
that ye be likeminded:1
not to them that believe:1
And she arose:3
yet would I not know my soul:1
let darkness seize upon it:1
besought him not to go up to Jerusalem:1
concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:1
And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel:1
I was sick:1
And if ye be Christ:1
and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much:1
Therefore let us keep the feast:1
A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land:1
though they caused their terror in the land of the living:1
and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels:1
and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels:1
neither if half of us die:1
and appeared unto many:1
If a man sin against his neighbour:1
For their vine is of the vine of Sodom:1
Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh:1
And they did according to the word of Moses:1
Then they shall answer:1
And another also said:1
Oh let not the LORD be angry:2
And Samson said unto them:3
yet is she thy companion:1
The sons of Ezer:1
two wings of every one were joined one to another:1
which accused them before our God day and night:1
because of men:2
And Abraham was old:1
and all things made of wood:1
and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination:1
I will ask thee a thing:1
but behold a cry:1
and Shilshah:1
seven:629
and they were brought into subjection under their hand:1
doth he open and break the clods of his ground:1
I have seen an end of all perfection:1
and deliver me from the hand of strange children:1
And they despised him:1
that they could not tell whence it was:1
and the waters increased:1
dost thou wash my feet:1
and keepeth them:1
neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more:1
It is naught:1
and none can stay his hand:1
and the glory of the LORD appeared:4
And the name of the third river is Hiddekel:1
Saul came to Carmel:1
that we will deal kindly and truly with thee:1
and the shekel great:1
and of thy liquors:1
and they brought out all her kindred:1
and desired of the king that he would give him time:1
Open to me the gates of righteousness:1
A fruitful land into barrenness:1
and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand:1
And he commanded the steward of his house:1
that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen:1
and reigned:13
Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people:1
that thy land be not defiled:1
He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity:1
s house in the day of thy calamity:1
And those that were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari:1
lest angry fellows run upon thee:1
To execute upon them the judgment written:1
Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother:1
lest thou be a cursed thing like it:1
and communed with the men of their city:1
and with a garment of fine linen and purple:1
which was the son of Cainan:1
and cause thine anger toward us to cease:1
I will complain in the bitterness of my soul:1
as the morning spread upon the mountains:1
And sold their possessions and goods:1
and sealed it with the king:1
and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar:1
that thou go out with his maidens:1
both to go out:1
When either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite:1
he goeth straightway to him:1
and slew her with the sword:1
and pitched in Kehelathah:1
and fine linen:9
and let it divide the waters from the waters:1
which was of Bahurim:1
near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph:1
s right hand shall be turned unto thee:1
have replenished:2
Eliahba the Shaalbonite:2
And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel:1
then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:1
beside the sons of the concubines:1
there came many to him into his lodging:1
and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes:1
and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you:1
that abundance of waters may cover thee:1
the rest of the people also cast lots:1
If I have spoken evil:1
Then David returned to bless his household:1
and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:1
The sons of Zophah:1
beware lest he take thee away with his stroke:1
until we shall have made ready a kid for thee:1
they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils:1
which thou:188
as the appearance of a sapphire stone:1
upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing:1
Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin:1
and there is none of you that is sorry for me:1
and I will cut off the Cherethims:1
have not I told thee from that time:1
and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia:1
and went up:21
and Tahan his son:1
Othni:8
and for all the evils which Herod had done:1
the one on thy right hand:1
thine end is come:1
And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived:1
Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart:1
Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant:1
and Joash:2
that as ye are partakers of the sufferings:1
Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me:1
for the day goeth away:1
For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth:1
saith thy God:2
as thou hast done:4
and the measure of thy covetousness:1
What sayest thou of thyself:1
And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first:1
s table:9
and let no man know where ye be:1
but by my spirit:1
and he blew a trumpet:2
for all that were present:1
And Noah awoke from his wine:1
Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art:1
and dwell for evermore:1
cast up the highway:1
Which when they had taken up:1
who smote them:1
and went whithersoever they could go:1
for that is the end of all men:1
thou earth:1
it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD:3
And Balaam said unto God:1
and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obededom:1
with diligence:1
for what God is there in heaven or in earth:1
that all the Israelites returned unto Ai:1
and sent them away:5
all the ends of the earth:7
and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus:1
and all the princes of Moab:1
which are gone up from you:1
And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine:1
But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God:1
and he came to the first:1
and execute judgment and justice:1
I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD:1
and shalt hallow it:1
or the noise of his tabernacle:1
Gershon:30
Brother Saul:2
and not a man dwell therein:1
Flee fornication:1
For they heard them speak with tongues:1
and repented according to the multitude of his mercies:1
I sat daily with you teaching in the temple:1
It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir:1
let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight:1
this is holy for the priest:1
s covenant:24
take the spoil of gold:1
s sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem:1
then shall thy light rise in obscurity:1
his countenance is as Lebanon:1
and servants that had knowledge of the sea:1
that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword:1
for a testimony against them:4
from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple:1
and seeth Abraham afar off:1
For if ye turn again unto the LORD:1
And a certain man found him:1
or a bone of a man:1
he sent forth other servants:1
And out of the tribe of Benjamin:2
And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach:1
and he was the son of an harlot:1
and had no business with any man:1
to destroy the city for my sake:1
I hid not my face from shame and spitting:1
Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in:1
all the cities with their villages:1
and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men:1
and they will shew thee:1
with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel:1
I will do so to him as he hath done to me:1
and there was a man there which had a withered hand:1
what a weariness is it:1
The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines:1
and the three eldest followed Saul:1
So Joshua did as Moses had said to him:1
Though I have afflicted thee:1
let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband:1
Remember that thou magnify his work:1
and one of you is a devil:1
let not the rebellious exalt themselves:1
Moreover the porters:1
when he had been sick:1
to give them light in the way wherein they should go:1
How shall we escape:1
and Shemuel:1
How are the mighty fallen:2
we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation:1
and carried away sheep and camels in abundance:1
so should I be delivered for ever from my judge:1
And the eunuch answered Philip:1
they that have done good:1
incline your ears to the words of my mouth:1
passing the love of women:1
And now I have told you before it come to pass:1
and thy land shall be divided by line:1
and let thy foreskin be uncovered:1
and he fell on his neck:1
The wicked have laid a snare for me:1
Therefore God dealt well with the midwives:1
being a servant:2
they shall be for a burnt offering unto the LORD:1
he will not afflict:1
for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ:1
cockatrices:1
and saw his brother Benjamin:1
in the ninth month:2
An old man cometh up:1
and he overlaid it with brass:1
to eat:88
even so:41
the daughter of Zion:16
and this people:4
and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan:1
for so had he appointed:1
which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses:1
and the captain of the children of Reuben shall be Elizur the son of Shedeur:1
until I come unto my lord unto Seir:1
And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac:1
Sarai:17
seek meekness:1
Ye shall not make with me gods of silver:1
To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father:1
and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar:2
Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD:1
A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities:1
if I bring him not unto thee:1
and great hailstones:2
Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound:1
until they came to a land inhabited:1
As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings:1
what ye shall eat:3
her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets:1
And Atroth:1
And they tarried till they were ashamed:1
called Euroclydon:1
Therefore David ran:1
and the hair thereof be not turned white:1
surely thus saith the LORD:1
Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time:1
and the upper:2
And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place:1
which came in and went out month by month throughout all the months of the year:1
and called them to the sacrifice:1
Whoso eateth my flesh:1
so that the wing of the one touched the one wall:1
How much less man:1
This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy:1
and Ezra the priest the scribe:1
that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel:1
make his praise glorious:1
they commune of laying snares privily:1
and all the people that are with him shall flee:1
which ye have both learned:1
Being filled with all unrighteousness:1
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving:1
the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:1
And he hath confirmed his words:1
For they will come out after us:1
I will even give them into the hand of their enemies:1
Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren:1
And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour:1
a just God and a Saviour:1
saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul:1
And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam:1
women:185
but I opened my doors to the traveller:1
to provoke him to anger:4
his substance:11
Of the children of Dan:1
But the fat:2
neither will I have any pity:1
for fear was round about:1
and it fell upon the third part of the rivers:1
We offend not:1
turned and said to the spirit:1
which he offered unto the LORD:1
s wife bare him no children:1
And her gates shall lament and mourn:1
calling upon God:1
she findeth no rest:1
And he smote him that he died:1
whose teeth are the teeth of a lion:1
that they may minister unto him:1
And no man after that durst ask him any question:1
and his two womenservants:1
even of the tribe of Manasseh:1
and I will cause my fury to rest upon them:1
because he seeth the light of this world:1
and Amen:3
that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity:1
But Nadab and Abihu died before their father:1
Shebuel was the chief:1
God forbid that I should do so:1
The cloths of service to do service in the holy place:1
and to scatter them in the lands:1
and they shall take away his dominion:1
from Bethjesimoth even unto Abelshittim in the plains of Moab:1
They are waxen fat:1
for he shall uncover the cedar work:1
which they prepared for Baal:1
for wherein is he to be accounted of:1
And Abel:2
even your perfection:1
s throne is in heaven:1
And it shall come to pass at that time:1
and what is Aaron:1
whose right hand I have holden:1
and the gier eagle:2
neither shall thy moon withdraw itself:1
governor on this side the river:4
and gather thee from the west:1
As God liveth:2
and there shall be a very great valley:1
and they will tell thee:1
and with his children:1
which reigned instead of Josiah his father:1
Of the tribe of Ephraim:1
he hath made it deep and large:1
And his people made no burning for him:1
Where is the LORD thy God:1
and for thy hired servant:1
to save him from those that condemn his soul:1
Nevertheless he left not himself without witness:1
Now that the dead are raised:1
of the tribe of Benjamin:8
and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee:1
And the first day of unleavened bread:1
my joy and crown:1
and the wind carried them away:1
And great fear came upon all the church:1
And the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fifty:1
and feared:3
and against the adulterers:1
Then said Jeremiah unto him:1
and cleave unto him:1
that thou shouldest take knowledge of me:1
and made an oration unto them:1
And he gave them their request:1
and twelve brasen bulls that were under the bases:1
Call her name Loruhamah:1
Sheba the son of Bichri by name:1
and Tidal king of nations:1
but the Holy Ghost:1
that all things which are written may be fulfilled:1
thou hast said unto the LORD:1
there must also of necessity be the death of the testator:1
So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia:1
as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before:1
And all they in the synagogue:1
and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day:1
obey your parents in the Lord:1
Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors:1
the daughter of Levi:1
Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king:1
and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen:1
The young lions do lack:1
to write unto thee in order:1
according to their families:27
and those which were possessed with devils:1
that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:1
and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD:1
yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks:1
For as the Father raiseth up the dead:1
God shall also glorify him in himself:1
For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God:1
for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah:1
when ye lived in them:1
And they departed from Succoth:1
both out of the law of Moses:1
because the fire of the LORD burnt among them:1
and follow after righteousness:1
and my servant Job shall pray for you:1
and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams:1
So that none of the remnant of Judah:1
because they have seen her nakedness:1
that ye may know and believe me:1
The LORD sitteth upon the flood:1
seven times seven years:1
and wisdom shall die with you:1
for they were all waiting for him:1
and Kartan with her suburbs:1
So there was a division among the people because of him:1
nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns:1
Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God:2
If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold:2
and his sons were Ulam and Rakem:1
which they shall not be able to escape:1
and Israel thy law:1
So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah:1
Thy men shall fall by the sword:1
why is it that thou hast sent him away:1
if thou refuse to let my people go:1
than for a man to hear the song of fools:1
that he should commit iniquity:1
gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle and three hundred oxen:1
on our solemn feast day:1
and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand:1
Then I said unto you:1
because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made:1
and is furious:1
which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman:1
so shall ye be established:1
s neck:26
for ye have perverted the words of the living God:1
And to the sons of Aaron they gave the cities of Judah:1
of making many books there is no end:1
and they shall keep my charge:1
till the whole was leavened:2
for thou shalt no more be called:2
and there they are unto this day:1
I will be exalted among the heathen:1
Then Agrippa said unto Festus:1
Hearken to the sound of the trumpet:1
And afterward offered the continual burnt offering:1
and yet true:1
and melt you:1
and had prayed with fasting:1
Let my people go:6
Now the children of Israel after their number:1
and ye shall seek me:1
Seeing it is one God:1
in the earth:68
Addon:1
he is excellent in power:1
and they thrust out Jephthah:1
and Israel shall be glad:2
mourn:135
He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel:1
because it reacheth unto thine heart:1
which ye have heard:4
How much more:5
and strangers from the covenants of promise:1
and dost thou teach us:1
who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians:1
and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings:1
that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam:1
and he shall magnify himself in his heart:1
he fell into a trance:1
These are those that were numbered:1
as one that mourneth for his mother:1
lest they bear sin for it:1
yet my people have forgotten me days without number:1
and went softly:2
for his seed remaineth in him:1
Then said Elkanah her husband to her:1
And Reuben heard it:1
of which one goeth up to the house of God:1
which is come forth to help you:1
and burnt up both the shocks:1
But the olive tree said unto them:1
and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven:1
and David took Methegammah out of the hand of the Philistines:1
Therefore said they unto him:1
God is a refuge for us:1
For even Christ pleased not himself:1
their sons:25
Young man:1
and get thee to Shiloh:1
And the king of Ai they took alive:1
neither will the Almighty pervert judgment:1
which was over against them:1
If not:2
Take thy bill:2
And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders:1
It is better that I give her to thee:1
And I will walk among you:1
but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins:1
they traded in thy market wheat of Minnith:1
For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal:1
when Baasha heard it:1
that they brought thirty companions to be with him:1
and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself:1
I will only:1
all of them shall wax old like a garment:1
he was not:10
I am found of them that sought me not:1
And put no difference between us and them:1
and asked counsel of God:1
and the aged arose:1
and will give them an heart of flesh:1
For we are in danger to be called in question for this day:1
It is sown in corruption:1
into thy resting place:1
and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us:1
and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage:1
he shall be holy:3
Then will I teach transgressors thy ways:1
and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand:1
Only Luke is with me:1
which she bare unto Nahor:1
Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition:1
not soon angry:1
O thou that dwellest in the land:1
and ye believed not:1
he fell down at Jesus:2
and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria:1
and the remnant shall be very small and feeble:1
lest in the battle he be an adversary to us:1
thou art terrible out of thy holy places:1
For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God:1
his locks are bushy:1
Of the Korhites was Meshelemiah the son of Kore:1
For all the wells which his father:1
Azrikam:6
yet will I not forget thee:1
he shall be exalted and extolled:1
Slay utterly old and young:1
Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle:1
The fear of the LORD prolongeth days:1
O heavens:2
and taught him knowledge:1
and didst eat with them:1
In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet:1
whether it be by life:1
Many waters cannot quench love:1
Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement:1
but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God:1
and they shall call it The valley of Hamongog:1
so he flourisheth:1
and eat not any unclean thing:1
while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David:1
and will comfort them:1
s strength also loveth judgment:1
The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom:1
Blessed is the man that endureth temptation:1
Surely I will never forget any of their works:1
so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more:1
though he wist it not:1
and he be jealous of his wife:2
but Jesus sent him away:1
and made her queen instead of Vashti:1
If I have walked with vanity:1
and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramothgilead:1
And Cornelius said:1
and into thy bedchamber:1
In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons:1
and learned their works:1
and the porch was before them:1
and unto all men:1
I was about to write:1
and greatly abhorred Israel:1
And he took six hundred chosen chariots:1
Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us:1
of the temple:45
or joy:20
upon one stone shall be seven eyes:1
and for controversies:1
and took the royal city:1
All these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of the LORD:1
And the elders of his house arose:1
and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat:1
If I be wicked:2
And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour:1
that even the winds and the sea obey him:1
And if the son of peace be there:1
if I have found grace in thy sight:1
but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces:1
their mules:2
in speaking such words unto them:1
But the end of all things is at hand:1
and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him:1
Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets:1
Moreover thou shalt say unto them:1
but I will reprove thee:1
and the name of the Chemarims with the priests:1
even they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of God:1
for we will not sit down till he come hither:1
but the proud he knoweth afar off:1
Who came with Zerubbabel:1
but Joshua lodged that night among the people:1
wandering stars:1
And they fell upon their faces:2
Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel:1
or what ye shall say:1
where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God:1
since I have seen thy face:1
neither fornicators:1
And Chelub the brother of Shuah begat Mehir:1
and eateth not the bread of idleness:1
Glory ye in his holy name:2
He maketh the deep to boil like a pot:1
that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee:1
and in Israel:3
and destroy the remnant of the sea coast:1
in thine anger:4
But sin:4
even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt:1
The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge:1
as willows by the water courses:1
Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust:1
and forgave him the debt:1
and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead:1
with lifting up their hands:1
And Jotham slept with his fathers:1
they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him:1
to his brethren:21
But if thou wilt go:1
And the angel said unto him:1
I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets:1
that I will hear:1
to have compassion upon thee:1
and in thine hand is power and might:1
therefore he polled it:1
Moses took one portion of fifty:1
and took also away much spoil from them:1
and so returned:1
and the king asked him secretly in his house:1
Wherein have we despised thy name:1
which he commanded you:2
and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled:1
What mean ye by these stones:1
This do:3
Having eyes full of adultery:1
And Gaal the son of Ebed went out:1
s house is:2
but is risen:1
and unto the confusion of thy mother:1
And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried:1
that I was at Shushan in the palace:1
Thus far is the judgment of Moab:1
Multitudes:1
and gone down to Gilgal:1
and of the hazel and chesnut tree:1
and Felix:1
I am God:10
Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord:1
and all that he did in Egypt:1
And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles:1
and now let us go:1
And he shall take the cedar wood:1
and Onam:2
I have given into thy hand the king of Ai:1
Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt:1
and they shall drink water by measure:1
and the hanging for the door at the entering in of the tabernacle:1
Then Simon Peter answered him:1
having great wrath:1
And Bilhah Rachel:1
And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him:1
and find much water:1
And that because of false brethren unawares brought in:1
and bows:1
and hid them by fifty in a cave:1
Thus speaketh Benhadad:1
And Delilah said to Samson:1
or need we:1
To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever:1
but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God:1
If the priest:2
and be not still:1
and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king:1
And thou shalt make curtains of goats:1
and in the psalms:1
And if it be any unclean beast:1
and he became her son:1
for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod:1
and on all thy father:1
And it was told Abimelech:1
And Ehud said:1
Kohath:47
and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate:1
are these:29
until the pursuers be returned:1
Therefore they gathered them together:1
three days:62
My heart shall cry out for Moab:1
And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth:1
the Lord reward him according to his works:1
and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel:2
for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few:1
neither shall he put any frankincense thereon:1
and to the excellent:1
and wild beasts:2
For where your treasure is:2
For no man ever yet hated his own flesh:1
that is near unto him:1
which is in thee by the putting on of my hands:1
shall be in danger of hell fire:1
And he took up his parable:5
when they go in:1
then say:8
the Jews putting him forward:1
that we may put them to death:2
For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram:1
Saying to a stock:1
David was thirty years old when he began to reign:1
and not by faith only:1
The LORD be witness between us:1
the work of my hands:3
For he received from God the Father honour and glory:1
and his purposes:2
to meet the Lord in the air:1
O arm of the LORD:1
whether they will hear:3
Therefore they sought again to take him:1
Prepare the table:1
and go out to the king of Israel:1
put up thyself into thy scabbard:1
Daniel answered in the presence of the king:1
Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD:1
Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers:1
And this shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem:1
expecting to receive something of them:1
what is that to thee:2
and have not kept his commandments:1
then will I stretch out mine hand upon it:1
and hast been partaker with adulterers:1
What is this that thou hast done:2
As they called them:1
and in the time of their trouble:1
even of the tribe of Gad:1
Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse:1
Ye have feared the sword:1
Where their worm dieth not:3
even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil:1
given to hospitality:2
and to them that give suck:3
and the burnt offering:5
but I asked him not whence he was:1
And he arose from thence:1
Philip:43
and to heal the sick:1
I commanded that the gates should be shut:1
it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth:1
and Jeremiah had remained there many days:1
But I was free born:1
and all the prophets prophesied before them:2
and all his flesh:1
in the hill country of Judah:1
and when the new moon was come:1
Because for thy sake I have borne reproach:1
that were born unto him:2
When men are cast down:1
the LORD will receive my prayer:1
that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness:1
and he shall bring down thy strength from thee:1
What hast thou brought forth:1
And take the helmet of salvation:1
and Homam:1
and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead:1
and vex it:1
For there shall be a day:1
and shall slay them with the sword:1
and our fathers found no sustenance:1
And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart:1
which is your glory:1
hast not forsaken them that seek thee:1
And she answered them:1
and he begat sons and daughters:2
If then God so clothe the grass:1
therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy:1
and to slay my son:1
she is the mother thereof:1
and to Tobijah:1
from the east side even unto the west side:2

the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up:1
the people of the land now are many:1
and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines:2
and laid a very great heap of stones upon him:1
and they had also John to their minister:1
for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him:1
even so do ye:1
And the second took her:2
He will swallow up death in victory:1
There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem:1
he shall cover his face:1
and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof:1
If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God:1
That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon:1
David stooped with his face to the earth:1
which also beareth fruit:1
When his branch is yet tender:1
Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold:1
We are able:1
Such is the way of an adulterous woman:1
but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit:1
and his name was Boaz:1
but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day:1
Sin shall have great pain:1
and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly:1
captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously:1
and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass:1
Lift up thine eyes unto the high places:1
and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle:1
but they would not give ear:1
And he sought Ahaziah:1
waiting at the posts of my doors:1
suffering wrongfully:1
and by peace shall destroy many:1
and it be called after my name:1
there is tidings in his mouth:1
he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes:1
and where thieves do not break through nor steal:1
How are the dead raised up:1
For I:151
The womb shall forget him:1
duke Zepho:1
and in the cities of the valley:1
from Arnon even unto Jabbok:2
Thy kingdom is divided:1
and Thomas called Didymus:1
and Job:7
except they repent of their deeds:1
For all things are your:1
out of the villages:1
If there be a prophet among you:1
but God meant it unto good:1
And from Jesus Christ:1
and they told Abimelech:1
two lambs of the first year without spot day by day:1
deceiving your own selves:1
And there went out fire from the LORD:1
even a leprosy upon the head or beard:1
had devised against the Jews to destroy them:1
And the wall that was without over against the chambers:1
and they made a very great burning for him:1
The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light:1
and filled her pitcher:1
and went up to Adar:1
if thou wilt receive my words:1
which have eyes:2
And they went out both of them into the field:1
Jonathan the son of Shimea David:1
and I will love him:1
Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies:1
every tongue shall swear:1
whatsoever things are true:1
when they feast with you:1
Then said the LORD unto Moses:1
when we were enemies:1
and of the Son:1
And he said unto him:36
It is not reason that we should leave the word of God:1
and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus:1
I taught Ephraim also to go:1
He hath filled me with bitterness:1
and all the people of war:3
and the hinges of gold:1
nor trimmed his beard:1
Azariah his son:1
it is a purification for sin:1
Ethiopia:40
to cover the chapiters that were upon the top:1
but if the salt have lost his savour:2
and in the fine linen:1
For I will surely deliver thee:1
neither have I hurt one of them:1
So David hid himself in the field:1
And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation:1
And satest upon a stately bed:1
whose name was Micha:1
for there was exceeding much spoil in them:1
have I declared unto you:1
the Almighty shall be thy defence:1
and charity:3
For when they shall say:1
deliver my soul from the wicked:1
but Seled died without children:1
in the openings of the gates:1
And Naarah bare him Ahuzam:1
for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel:1
give him bread to eat:1
how dwelleth the love of God in him:1
and he sware:2
And the people blessed all the men:1
all ye that kindle a fire:1
our kings:9
made he of gold:1
his teeth shall be set on edge:1
Why askest thou me:1
that he hath opened thine eyes:1
all ye that fear God:1
Pilate said unto them:3
Judah shall go up:2
It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God:1
number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan:1
and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest:1
and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron:1
But the word of the Lord endureth for ever:1
the children of Hakupha:2
for he transgressed against the LORD his God:1
s gate clothed with sackcloth:1
Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath:1
I have not told it my father nor my mother:1
And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest:1
And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David:1
I would not tell thee:1
and wherein we have sinned:1
the heaven was opened:1
s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram:1
but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding:1
let all the people praise thee:2
and anointed him in the midst of his brethren:1
and is faithful with the saints:1
And at Enrimmon:1
For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine:1
in the wilderness:155
thou son of man:15
And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel:1
until thou be destroyed:4
And they parted his raiment:1
wash me:1
My soul hath kept thy testimonies:1
I will make thee an eternal excellency:1
And she vowed a vow:1
And he set the priests in their charges:1
And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold:2
forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me hitherto:1
he is the God:3
for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life:1
having no necessity:1
And Samson said concerning them:1
who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel:1
as he commanded him:1
s word was abominable to Joab:1
I have set before thee this day life and good:1
The snare is laid for him in the ground:1
thou takest away their breath:1
neither seek after wizards:1
And he charged them that they should tell no man of him:1
and reign over us:3
For all this they sinned still:1
And all these thy servants shall come down unto me:1
and not killed:1
return unto me:4
that it might bring forth branches:1
the Benjamites looked behind them:1
These are the families of the children of Gad according to those that were numbered of them:1
and the earth was reaped:1
neither hid:1
Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests:1
from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him:1
s soul:54
In those days came John the Baptist:1
to do that which is right in mine eyes:1
Thou hast clothing:1
the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people:1
He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye:1
to work in all manner of workmanship:1
And they spit upon him:1
and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee:1
and fell on his face to the ground:1
when they spake daily unto him:1
which was the son of Esli:1
and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour:1
Beerah his son:1
did eat:94
And I will appoint over them four kinds:1
and the lieutenants:1
speak to the men of Judah:1
The LORD shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee:1
Put:31
For three transgressions of Edom:1
Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon:1
chief fathers:9
and then lifted up their voices:1
that the tabernacle was reared up:2
Then Paul:8
the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer:1
and upon the sheep:1
For none of us liveth to himself:1
For since by man came death:1
and his hands shall restore their goods:1
I am become a fool in glorying:1
And Jacob vowed a vow:1
eat that thou findest:1
and joint-heirs with Christ:1
as signets are graven:1
the angel of the Lord came upon him:1
And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after:1
in which ye came out from Egypt:1
Also thou shalt lie down:1
but the people magnified them:1
and come again to you:1
That they teach you not to do after all their abominations:1
and weighed the mountains in scales:1
all his commandments are sure:1
and whatsoever thou spendest more:1
and the bracelet that was on his arm:1
ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us:1
to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof:1
among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her:1
And whatsoever is first ripe in the land:1
And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times:1
or vinegar of strong drink:1
even unto Hormah:2
let thy word:6
and Javan:4
And there was found at Achmetha:1
the abjects gathered themselves together against me:1
But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him:1
and no man gathereth them:1
For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down:1

and all the high hills:1
and all his seed with him:1
he had power over the angel:1
for I will there make of thee a great nation:1
for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted:1
and trample them in my fury:1
And he promised:1
and they slew them:1
And yet for all that:1
and my fingers to fight:1
and wilt serve them:1
That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD:1
and marble:2
and he shall divide the spoil with the strong:1
which are as a shadow:1
in the best of the land:2
O thou wicked servant:1
the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike:1
Go to now:3
and for the devils:1
that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law:1
there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon:1
because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people:1
and took her:6
which is of the law:3
and six cubits broad on the other side:1
For I will restore health unto thee:1
and where thou lodgest:1
That which was from the beginning:1
bosom:41
All these things have I kept from my youth up:1
Therefore I will not refrain my mouth:1
that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel:1
thou hast been honourable:1
What do these Hebrews here:1
they were not of double heart:1
sit not down in the highest room:1
and is healed:1
pure and holy:1
rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter:1
Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers:1
Which remain among the graves:1
according to the proportion of every one:1
for there are seven abominations in his heart:1
he was in the mountains:1
even all the works of this pattern:1
which brought fish:1
But what saith it:1
And Balak said unto Balaam:4
And they shall be gathered together:1
and is truth:1
Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines:1
and made them white in the blood of the Lamb:1
s grave unto this day:1
Then Peter said unto her:1
and they shall wither:1
lest ye be condemned:1
the son of Gershom:3
and anoint thee:1
and they that followed:1
for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob:1
Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together:1
that be in the midst of you:1
of thy wine:4
and became one troop:1
and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him:1
but he will call to remembrance the iniquity:1
and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again:1
Howbeit the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever:1
Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city:1
but the wicked shall be filled with mischief:1
And again they said:1
But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite:1
And when he went out the second day:1
let them also that hate him flee before him:1
his breast and his arms of silver:1
when he had conferred with the council:1
How think ye:1
and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah:1
when they offered strange fire before the LORD:2
and she bare him Aaron and Moses:1
with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance:1
a deceived heart hath turned him aside:1
But thus do unto them:1
and the men that were with him:4
Then sent Joseph:1
and see my brethren:1
how shall he not with him also freely give us all things:1
Let thy garments be always white:1
They are terrible and dreadful:1
but that it should be holy and without blemish:1
He sent Moses his servant:1
and the name of his city was Dinhabah:2
and they told him:1
or if it run beyond the time of her separation:1
Ummah also:1
Thy brother is come:1
and silver:25
this day have I payed my vows:1
Stolen waters are sweet:1
blessed is the man that trusteth in him:1
even I know:1
neither have ye sought that which was lost:1
And he lifted up his eyes:3
were twelve:30
for his great love wherewith he loved us:1
In the number of all the males:1
and the mountain of Israel:1
and all the Israelites were gathered together:1
and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:1
is in God:2
and from every hill:1
and the hyssop:2
worshipping the LORD:1
and horror hath overwhelmed me:1
and thou shalt not prosper in them:1
for I stand in doubt of you:1
whose house is by the sea side:1
Whithersoever they went out:1
The way of man is froward and strange:1
having separated himself:1
And his deeds:1
nine hundred and fifty and six:1
And all the congregation said that they would do so:1
She is loud and stubborn:1
Which was the son of Mattathias:1
the similitude of any figure:1
For as by one man:1
and he loved also Rachel more than Leah:1
even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus:1
of Jeremiah:15
because they have now been with me three days:1
which shall be in the land of Egypt:1
for he commandeth even the winds and water:1
And his brethren were content:1
and the breadth shall be ten thousand:1
and having said thus:1
and the strong men shall bow themselves:1
without the camp shall his habitation be:1
Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion:1
and make the stars thereof dark:1
I count not myself to have apprehended:1
thither will the eagles be gathered together:1
see to thine own house:2
And all the elders of Israel came:2
Get thee up:5
Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread:1
They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent:1
Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD:1
and unto thy seed:1
Yet:116
and by the arm of his strength:1
because the LORD had shut up her womb:1
and hath he not given you rest on every side:1
and thou art troubled:1
Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain:1
for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about:1
and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver:1
For I came down from heaven:1
ye shall abide in my love:1
Now my days are swifter than a post:1
nor the desire of women:1
Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all:1
that shall not be cut off:2
At the same time spake the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz:1
endued with prudence and understanding:1
they departed every man unto his place:1
though I walk in the imagination of mine heart:1
for perjured persons:1
that we should be called the sons of God:1
and as he drew near to behold it:1
and every one four wings:1
the son of Buz:2
On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews:1
Then Eli answered and said:1
If ye were of the world:1
and put it upon thy loins:1
whether by word:1
and went throughout all Israel:1
they sanctified it:2
far be it from me:1

and all thy company that are assembled unto thee:1
but grievous words stir up anger:1

waiting for the consolation of Israel:1
The wicked watcheth the righteous:1
sincerity:7
the father of Keilah the Garmite:1
Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer:1
and so doth Marcus my son:1
thou hast received gifts for men:1
the old man of whom ye spake:1
To know wisdom and instruction:1
So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest:1
Rabboni:1
I am bowed down greatly:1
And with him they crucify two thieves:1
And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold:1
verily I say unto you:13
Sodom thy sister hath not done:1
Elizur the son of Shedeur:5
wilt thou not surely put me to death:1
And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year:1
envyings:1
s house in Tahpanhes:1
shall come over unto thee:1
which hath been sold unto thee:1
Then answered Peter and said unto him:2
when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them:1
they shall wallow themselves in the ashes:1
For if the blood of bulls and of goats:1
But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you:1
They are passed away as the swift ships:1
Prophesy not unto us right things:1
Should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets:1
and he will teach us of his ways:2
Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation:1
that durst presume in his heart to do so:1
which he kept not:1
walking:30
nothing worthy of death is done unto him:1
Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks:1
Thus shalt thou say unto him:1
he shook the kingdoms:1
not as we hoped:1
and it shall be a desolate heap:1
and when ye did drink:1
Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein:1
for these are the two covenants:1

and other of the Levites:1
in their set office:4
and pray for them which despitefully use you:2
which we cannot comprehend:1
but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness:1
Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him:1
in their mouth:12
and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans:1
beside the inhabitants of Gibeah:1

and the lame and the blind that are hated of David:1
though we have rebelled against him:1
And there went a man of the house of Levi:1
and passed along to Hezron:1
and their wives:11
I saw the LORD standing upon the altar:1
And he came and found them asleep again:1
and thy people for his people:1
The fig tree putteth forth her green figs:1
for he feared to say:1
and teachest him out of thy law:1
And his heart was moved:1
they shall be of fine flour:1
and brake the pitchers:2
nor of Ahlab:1
and are dead:2
I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings:1

And Lot went out:2
And so ordain I in all churches:1
Wherefore the name of that place was called:1
Art thou bound unto a wife:1
to stand before the LORD to minister unto him:1
lest he be grieved:1
Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge:1
and the teeth of the young lions:1

and the land is defiled:1
If thou wilt give me half thine house:1
evil concupiscence:1
Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah:1
In thy name shall they rejoice all the day:1
Let the young men now arise:1
For then shall be great tribulation:1
set it here before my brethren and thy brethren:1
for by the law is the knowledge of sin:1

And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him:1
and not for your destruction:1
and pulled me in pieces:1

and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel:1
saith the LORD of hosts unto you:1
and it brought forth wild grapes:1
because he kept my commandments and my statutes:1
and brought me through:2
and the worms cover thee:1
neither shall they be buried:1
The harvest is past:1
Then shall an oath of the LORD be between them both:1
but ye seek to kill me:1
unto the Lord our God:1
and to Mishael:1
when thine heart is not with me:1
in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa:1
but have pleasure in them that do them:1
the days are coming:1
The enemy shall not exact upon him:1
that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God:1
beside the other in her life time:1
and lodged us three days courteously:1
their rock in whom they trusted:1
and fell down from the third loft:1
Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men:1
for he shall receive of mine:1
He is the LORD our God:2
nor right:1
and that there be no divisions among you:1
and upon the garments of his sons with him:1

and madness is in their heart while they live:1

and all the people answered with one voice:1
according to the commandment of David:4

then all the cattle bare speckled:1
and spreadeth his cloud upon it:1

After all this:1

the sons of Abinadab:1
A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit:1
and led him into their council:1
The LORD maketh poor:1
that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the heathen:1
Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard:1
I have determined to send him:1

and made them swear by God:1
why:139
and unto the land of them:1
but especially the parchments:1
This shall be the service of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation:1
to find out the account:1
Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master:1
from his city:1
And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years:1
I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth:1

and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible:1
as the fishes that are taken in an evil net:1
and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth:1
because they repented at the preaching of Jonas:1
But they that have gathered it shall eat it:1
and the goings out thereof were at the sea:1

bind the tire of thine head upon thee:1
because they suffered such things:1
and of rebuke:1
from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon:1
the whole head is sick:1
Ye are our gods:2
then whose shall those things be:1
and thrust his sword in his fellow:1
When thou wast little in thine own sight:1
in truth and in righteousness:1
It is as high as heaven:1
the one toward the other:1
how Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of Egypt:1
And when we had launched from thence:1
Let there be none to extend mercy unto him:1
How is the gold become dim:1

and let no man dwell therein:1

and the children of Ammon:7
He hath not dealt so with any nation:1
Go ye every man unto his city:1
Whom do men say that I am:1

not seeking mine own profit:1

which is shed for many for the remission of sins:1
to the worm:1
Neither be ye called masters:1
thou that didst not travail with child:1
And a great multitude followed him:1
and before Eleazar the priest:2
And when they had received it:1

whether it be a carcase of an unclean beast:1
into the hand of them from whom thy mind is alienated:1
when he beheld the serpent of brass:1
and Josabad the Gederathite:1
but the LORD was not in the wind:1
If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness:1

and trode down the thistle:1

And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years:1

and fled unto Lystra and Derbe:1
when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples:1
declare:130
and further brought Greeks also into the temple:1
and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it:1
As an eagle stirreth up her nest:1

all the chief of the people:1

and Zaavan:1
and with songs:1
the family of the Naamites:1
even the blood of their sons and of their daughters:1

and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem:2
I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress:1
What is written in the law:1
And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall:1
And the people chode with Moses:1
and shall be quiet from fear of evil:1

but divide it:1
and brought them to Jericho:1
that soul shall be cut off from among his people:3
gathered themselves together:33
and my brethren:7
but disguised himself:1
for they shall heap dust:1
and one that feared God with all his house:1
the word of the LORD tried him:1
they shall make haste to the wall thereof:1
and the princes of the king:1
Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:1
and make her as a wilderness:1
and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost:1
I came not to send peace:1
and things which are despised:1
and ten thousand at thy right hand:1
but his hand is stretched out still:5
and we shall reign on the earth:1
So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month:1
he shall never taste of death:1
and object:1
he and his princes together:1
Who gave himself a ransom for all:1
And when Absalom:1
so that I could remove mountains:1
and there was no counsellor:1
And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish:1
It came to pass after this also:1
of wood:19
And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards:1
By faith he forsook Egypt:1
in that we saw the anguish of his soul:1
the damsel:36
they shall rest in their beds:1
For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer:1
and the multitude of their cattle a spoil:1
And when the woman saw Samuel:1
with the interpretation thereof:1
but they put new wine into new bottles:1
and the seven good ears are seven years:1
doth his promise fail for evermore:1
and Benaiah:14
And this is love:1
but having his eyes open:2
why persecutest thou me:3
and all the house of Israel that are among them:1
when he was in Mesopotamia:1
he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings:1
and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur:1
neither understand they his counsel:1
being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant:1
for this time is evil:1
Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin:1
and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace:1
Kadmiel and his sons:1
And I will dwell among the children of Israel:2
and indignation:1
And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen:1
will I sing:8
And they removed from Tarah:1
So the LORD was intreated for the land:1
Who against hope believed in hope:1
though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee:1
but the Pharisees confess both:1
but he hath not given me over unto death:1
And they brought in the ark of the LORD:1
Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah:1
the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously:1
And she say to me:1
for he was grieved for David:1
And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem:1
and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered:1
and a colt the foal of an ass:1
and she called his name Asher:1
Arm some of yourselves unto the war:1
and brought Israel by their tribes:1
shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus:1
And Joshua made peace with them:1
Tychicus and Trophimus:1
And the men turned their faces from thence:1
Neither hath oppressed any:1
and put on the brigandines:1
these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness:1
to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up:1
I am their possession:1
And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease:1
prophesy unto the mountains of Israel:1
he rejoiceth more of that sheep:1
and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat:1
the Holy Ghost came on them:1
neither shalt thou lay upon him usury:1
but much increase is by the strength of the ox:1
wherein is the covenant of the LORD:2
he is the King of glory:1
and westward:4
Asaiah the firstborn:1
and feet was I to the lame:1
and gavest them water for their thirst:1
his spirit came again to him:1
know our entrance in unto you:1
to do with them as it seemeth good to thee:1
righteously:9
and we pine away in them:1
that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses:1
Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech:1
and upon them that have daubed it with untempered morter:1
for ye know the heart of a stranger:1
and put it upon the horns of the altar:7
And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines:1
and a word spoken in due season:1
Then said Joshua:1
nor did him reverence:2
of a whole piece shalt thou make them:1
Art thou a king then:1
and they were read before the king:1
and thou shalt not fall by the sword:1
that I may set mine eyes upon him:1
and mocked the Jews:1
wait:157
and stood before the LORD:3
But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done:1
and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually:1
The mountains melted from before the LORD:1
and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever:1
that he may dip the tip of his finger in water:1
Take thee ten pieces:1
and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked:1
And to the sons of Gershom throughout their families out of the tribe of Issachar:1
because ye do not lay it to heart:1
that he may sleep in his own raiment:1
either that all the sons of Jerubbaal:1
and Lehabim:2
submit yourselves unto your own husbands:2
and it shall devour them:1
As many as I love:1
They reel to and fro:1
and all Judah and Israel that were present:1
that I should release unto you one at the passover:1
I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God:1
and sweareth falsely:1
Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God:1
Love not sleep:1
he shall slay me:2
Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation:1
The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren:1
A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people:1
even the night shall be light about me:1
and thou shalt come up:1
they shall stand upon the land:1
And was drawn from the north:1
For the Pharisees:1
gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the LORD your God:1
Depart ye:3
there shall not a man of them stand before thee:1
And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire:1
or profane:4
there was no more spirit in her:2
Set me as a seal upon thine heart:1
and remained unmoveable:1
but before two or three witnesses:1
in the land of Egypt:58
them Joshua circumcised:1
and playedst the harlot because of thy renown:1
And Jonathan cried after the lad:1
ye kindreds of the people:2
And the cow and the bear shall feed:1
and departed into a solitary place:1
and said unto him that stood before me:1
because they have transgressed my covenant:1
and the man of wisdom shall see thy name:1
and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place:1
and peaceable:2
and our sins testify against us:1
Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people:1
or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep:1
and a man:10
And Jesus answered them:1
ye shall pour it upon the earth as water:1
whose father and mother we know:1
they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus:2
left his wife unto his brother:1
for he will not pardon your transgressions:1
That thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place:1
and he gave the cup into Pharaoh:1
Their throat is an open sepulchre:1
and bread:11
Jesus Christ:198
and fell down:12
And if they be bound in fetters:1
But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under:1
Hasten hither Micaiah the son of Imlah:1
and will remove thy candlestick out of his place:1
nor shoes:1
even as we are one:1
what have we:3
I have heard them:1
and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed:1
and break down the wall thereof:1
If any man shall add unto these things:1
and they entered into the city:1
as we were driven up and down in Adria:1
the daughter of Mezahab:2
And all the people were amazed:1
let us lay wait for blood:1
kings of Midian:5
Who gave Jacob for a spoil:1
but the other holy offerings sod they in pots:1
he will render unto her a recompence:1
for they also went unto the feast:1
who vexed them:1
because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor:1
For this was a statute for Israel:1
and ye dig a pit for your friend:1
and his bones are moistened with marrow:1
and when he arose against me:1
The Lord is risen indeed:1
that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want:1
and be enlarged:1
Moses wrote unto us:2
and every branch that beareth fruit:1
an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour:1
I made their streets waste:1
Because I am not the hand:1
These are the dukes that came of the Horites:1
and Heshbon:1
Whereupon:8
and would have killed himself:1
and in thy name we go against this multitude:1
Also twenty basons of gold:1
let him not leave us:1
And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp:1
and lead him away safely:1
if they should be written every one:1
and her desert like the garden of the LORD:1
square round about:1
Then Simon himself believed also:1
For he cast two pillars of brass:1
These things hast thou done:1
paintedst thy eyes:1
Tell me therefore:1
And in my prosperity I said:1
which was the son of Sala:2
All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem:1
and now am old:1
in the ears of all the people:2
I will send thee a kid from the flock:1
and to all the women:1
which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations:1
But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony:1
the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace:1
and remember it as waters that pass away:1
and set battering rams against it round about:1
Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given possession in Bashan:1
It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the house:1
Sing aloud unto God our strength:1
which came from Judah:1
Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us:1
and the ambushment was behind them:1
and whom he would he kept alive:1
Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith:1
I will shake the heavens and the earth:1
and the Egyptians shall know the LORD in that day:1
and great fear came on all them that heard these things:1
And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged:1
if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity:1
with dyed garments from Bozrah:1
whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz:1
or if there be caterpiller:1
unto a nation that was not called by my name:1
Shall Christ come out of Galilee:1
and there is none upright among men:1
according to the breadth of the house:3
He went away again the second time:1
as the LORD said:2
of the fowl:5
and he called them:1
Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back:1
And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not:1
and said to the king:3
we spend our years as a tale that is told:1
As we have therefore opportunity:1
and they came into the camp:1
until it be leavened:1
and ran:17
thou hast blessed the work of his hands:1
and will make thee a burnt mountain:1
Jeshua:30
And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem:1
let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac:1
that they turned back from pursuing him:1
and grind the faces of the poor:1
ye shall serve God upon this mountain:1
Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan:1
courts:23
And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD:1
I will be with him in trouble:1
and knew not that it was Jesus:1
And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh:1
thou art stronger than I:1
and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father:1
that the LORD said unto me:1
who hath gathered the wind in his fists:1
which are called by my name:2
and set him for their watchman:1
he sacrificed oxen and fatlings:1
If thou knewest the gift of God:1
and not for our:1
s lips should keep knowledge:1
a Zebulonite:1
yet have I made myself servant unto all:1
Are not these evils come upon us:1
after that it was anointed:1
after that the ark had rest:1
But if he be poorer than thy estimation:1
And God looked upon the children of Israel:1
and Israel for his peculiar treasure:1
s house shall be established in the top of the mountains:1
And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate without:1
All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume:1
those that thou gavest me I have kept:1
and great in power:1
and do his commandments and his statutes:1
for they might not be seen to come into the city:1
but he answered nothing:1
and laid him upon his own bed:1
to save thee:2
and Thomas with them:1
and came to the Ancient of days:1
Shuthelah:4
will Saul come down:1
and ye gave me meat:1
but the hand of the diligent maketh rich:1
which I knew not:3
Thus shalt thou say unto Joab:1
Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit:1
and uncover the woman:1
For sin:6
and lacketh bread:1
It is the spirit that quickeneth:1
according to their way and according to their doings I judged them:1
and to the beasts of the field:2
and they which hate us spoil for themselves:1
being not without law to God:1
And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds:1
his brother came out:1
and they seemed unto him but a few days:1
Thus saith the king:4
And the LORD said:139
are the sons of Aaron:2
I will set my face against you for evil:1
Neither let us tempt Christ:1
Then they told David:1
and the people mourned greatly:1
ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods:1
And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem:1
If so be they will hearken:1
Keep thy tongue from evil:1
to play the whore in her father:1
only the LORD establish his word:1
but all the firstborn of my children I redeem:1
and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people:1
he sitteth between the cherubims:1
And David assembled the children of Aaron:1
neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold:1
And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners:1
these were the priests:1
and lest they should say:1
if a man devour you:1
and led forth his people:1
for thou art a stiffnecked people:2
A fool:10
which are gone down with the slain:1
A day of darkness and of gloominess:1
Having a good conscience:1
beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham:1
for the people will not eat until he come:1
but is come from a far country for thy great name:1
and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand:1
and demanded who he was:1
I am Alpha and Omega:4
to smite the host of the Philistines:2
set upon sockets of fine gold:1
and Beeshterah with her suburbs:1
and girded himself:1
but deceiveth his own heart:1
to cast out the horns of the Gentiles:1
And the singers sang loud:1
And I will set fire in Egypt:1
Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD:1
Holding forth the word of life:1
and remain in the wilderness:1
be not afraid:13
and their eyes have they closed:1
He divideth the sea with his power:1
and my graven image:1
the years of ancient times:1
s house which was toward the north:1
a fourth part of the wall:1
Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners:1
they were filled with envy:1
and it hath been testified to his owner:1
they have killed thy prophets:1
called Barabbas:1
while he taught in the temple:1
whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death:1
and wreaths of chain work:1
which the LORD God of Israel had given:1
it devoured men:1
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour:1
when he shall hear it:1
and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem:1
neither will they understand:1
and in the hands of his sons:1
gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse:1
for it is a stiffnecked people:1
write thee the name of the day:1
And had turned their rivers into blood:1
But ye are come unto mount Sion:1
and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee:1
and stand forth in the midst:1
and my soul shall not abhor you:1
that lay on forty five pillars:1
Touching the Almighty:1
And the most proud shall stumble and fall:1
And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel:1
And Moses was content to dwell with the man:1
for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet:1
Thus saith the LORD of thee:1
and the fire is not quenched:3
and put the child therein:1
the LORD do so to me:1
and hast not told it me:1
Having damnation:1
because he touched the hollow of Jacob:1
The third to Zaccur:1
and I heard a voice of one that spake:1
and set a king in the midst of it:1
And David said unto Michal:1
and from the middle of the river:1
Behold his bed:1
lest they destroy my son:1
and there was light:1
Be still:2
I dreamed a dream:1
feet:249
but if thou scornest:1
with fine linen of Egypt:1
and consume away for their iniquity:1
s but you:1
he doth send out his voice:1
Hushim:4
thine only son:3
whosoever sinneth hath not seen him:1
Nathanael answered and saith unto him:1
for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee:1
Israel is fled before the Philistines:1
for her price is far above rubies:1
an Ephrathite of Zereda:1
against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt:1
if thou hast understanding:1
and to the brethren:1
six hundred and ninety:1
do make a decree to all the treasurers which are beyond the river:1
who commanded the light to shine out of darkness:1
nor suffer my faithfulness to fail:1
and of pearls:1
and not be silent:1
or else be absent:1
Naboth did blaspheme God and the king:1
Shall I go down after the Philistines:1
that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina:1
He causeth it to come:1
and all that thou hast:4
shall the earth be forsaken for thee:1
Now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad:1
and my flock became meat to every beast of the field:1
And if thou say in thine heart:2
For the vile person will speak villany:1
planted by the waters:2
thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire:1
In the way of righteousness is life:1
which drown men in destruction and perdition:1
they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people:1
I would despise my life:1
Then said Daniel unto the king:1
thou didst thresh the heathen in anger:1
I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world:1
Jahath his son:1
and begat Serug:1
but hired Balaam against them:1
the scribe:75
knowest thy servant:2
and thine heart shall utter perverse things:1
ye say:50
and I will cut him off from the midst of my people:1
And I will make with them a covenant of peace:1
the work of thy fingers:1
And I gave her space to repent of her fornication:1
He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good:1
and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph:1
Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel:1
And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day:1
and be set at nought:1
all their princes as Zebah:1
and not sons:1
and yet is not washed from their filthiness:1
Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead:2
and Kirjathaim:2
I thank thee:5
in the land of Juda:12
Which was a figure for the time then present:1
Foursquare it shall be being doubled:1
That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham:1
out of the low dungeon:1
with the flowers:1
s loins:19
If thou hast nothing to pay:1
And there came out a fire from the LORD:1
O ye mighty:1
three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof:1
Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance:1
Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree:1
and be delighted with the abundance of her glory:1
and Eshean:1
I have sworn:9
until he came out:1
he shall both wash his clothes:1
even till thou come to Minnith:1
I would harden myself in sorrow:1
he that is born in the house:1
we stand before this house:1
When there were no depths:1
and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe:1
he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes:1
That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets:1
and I will turn unto you:2
which consumed them as stubble:1
and gave him land:1
even the LORD:6
and stretch her wings toward the south:1
and not have enough:1
and prophesy against the land of Israel:1
Zechariah the firstborn:1
for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth:1
and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God:1
and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts:1
but it shall come to pass:1
and he became a captain over them:1
and in the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem:1
If one be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it:1
The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart:1
And they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet:1
and excellent in working:1
to his city:5
but when the sun ariseth they flee away:1
they shall be unto you without blemish:3
that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness:1
s business:7
A divine sentence is in the lips of the king:1
as they departed from him:1
and Eshban:2
for he hath given you the former rain moderately:1
ye clothe you:2
and their rulers:1
and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering:1
and cast into the fire:3
and bring wood:1
but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat:1
and his heart shall be against the holy covenant:1
And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place:1
But oh that God would speak:1
And he took the captains of hundreds:1
And when even was now come:1
The Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold:1
If I had not done among them the works which none other man did:1
and was fast asleep:1
but behold oppression:1
and cry aloud:2
O most mighty:1
But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty:1
that she obtained favour in his sight:1
With thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches:1
And they digged another well:1
of those that went with David:1
and when they came near unto the altar:1
if there remain ten men in one house:1
and for the honour of my majesty:1
And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua:1
they shall cry aloud from the sea:1
and drawing nigh unto the ship:1
that they could not recover themselves:1
and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand:1
Return unto the land of thy fathers:1
and for the children of Shemida:1
I do not repent:1
or for his land:1
and what is my sin before thy father:1
therefore came his father out:1
with despiteful minds:1
Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing:1
for thou hast found grace in my sight:1
when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field:1
when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle:1
That which he laboured for shall he restore:1
let us do good unto all men:1
and not thine own lips:1
such as his father loved:1
so shalt thou drive them out:1
and did as the LORD commanded Moses:1
from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders:1
this is our God:1
I have made their vintage shouting to cease:1
and thou shalt have no more soothsayers:1
and they took them wives of all which they chose:1
him declare I unto you:1
the word of the LORD is tried:2
and my heart is wounded within me:1
The son of Izhar:1
when your obedience is fulfilled:1
And he brought me into the inner court toward the east:1
Of the sons of Hashum:1
if they would testify:1
whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God:1
old man:21
For your shame ye shall have double:1
the flock of thine heritage:1
And know ye this day:1
and made them an ordinance in Israel:1
of a surety she is thy wife:1
they shall be troubled in their countenance:1
O friends:1
her candle goeth not out by night:1
they say of me:1
Because of your unbelief:1
and set it as a willow tree:1
governments:1
and being in the house he asked them:1
Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:1
and palms in their hands:1
and she ran and told her father:1
For God commanded:1
lean from day to day:1
if the man should yet come thither:1
and a law of the God of Jacob:1
or if thou hast thought evil:1
and Jebusites:2
as an error which proceedeth from the ruler:1
On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben according to their armies:1
Then Saul said to Jonathan:1
Now the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions in their cities were:1
And his brethren could not answer him:1
Middin:1
by a certain number:1
as he promised:5
and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands:1
Then were they all of good cheer:1
say ye that the Lord hath need of him:1
And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum:1
Is it nothing to you:1
for I have written a letter unto you in few words:1
and came to their house to Ramah:1
Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images:1
And would to God this people were under my hand:1
I am the door:2
and called upon the name of the LORD:2
Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD:1
And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne:1
they cried out:10
the branch of my planting:1
of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour:1
And the priest shall put on his linen garment:1
for their eyes were heavy:2
the chief of the fathers:21
who shall give you that which is your own:1
And I will pray the Father:1
I cry unto thee:7
and saith unto Peter:2
that thou shalt take of the water of the river:1
it is become like a stick:1
Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle:1
I have called upon thee:2
here is seed for you:1
and prevailed against thee:1
Woe is me now:2
but make not a full end:1
and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted:2
Let them not fail to burn the fat presently:1
And thou shalt say unto them:3
The LORD is my God:1
and went after him:1
Which was the son of Cainan:1
Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand:1
And he leaping up stood:1
how great is the sum of them:1
our helper in Christ:1
that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man:1
whom God raised from the dead:1
when they heard that Jesus passed by:1
As birds flying:1
and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned:1
s door:1
and shalt deliver his soul from hell:1
unto the Jews a stumblingblock:1
Unto John:1
And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots:1
and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about:1
s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth:1
and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly:1
the poor also:1
he asked what it meant:1
a mighty man is not delivered by much strength:1
Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation:1
thou hast heard the desire of the humble:1
when he had cried again with a loud voice:1
For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory:1
Ramah:35
Then saith he to his servants:1
and served Baal and Ashtaroth:1
But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza:1
he hath given occasions of speech against her:1
were fifty and seven thousand and four hundred:2
So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city:1
For this cause I Paul:1
But Peter stood at the door without:1
thou art not able to perform it thyself alone:1
And I heard the angel of the waters say:1
And Cornelius waited for them:1
And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years:1
and the heart of his servants:1
and he that rolleth a stone:1
early will I seek thee:1
And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields:1
do unto her:2
see ye the word of the LORD:1
And to wait for his Son from heaven:1
that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel:1
All things are full of labour:1
and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel:1
and let the sword be doubled the third time:1
I the God of Israel will not forsake them:1
For thus saith the LORD God of Israel unto me:1
spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid:1
doeth he it by the works of the law:1
Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up:1
and all that is dressed in the fryingpan:1
These were of the sons of Gad:1
And when Jesus saw her:1
with shouting:8
that they abode in their places in the camp:1
recompence to his enemies:2
Who would have said unto Abraham:1
and let the LORD do that which is good in his sight:1
because I said:2
for the right of inheritance is thine:1
and heard him concerning the faith in Christ:1
Then Samuel took a stone:1
anguish and sorrows have taken her:1
and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah:1
But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel:1
Storehouses also for the increase of corn:1
And they departed from Rephidim:1
and drank wine before the thousand:1
then they will be thy servants for ever:1
And he did wash the inwards and the legs:1
And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground:1
And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years:1
many are they that rise up against me:1
and when thou art athirst:1
therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them:1
he put darkness between you and the Egyptians:1
ye shall not offer these unto the LORD:1
to the pestilence:2
which shall be of thy sons:1
and in the wilderness:3
which were in their villages:1
let me escape thither:1
and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you:1
Rakkath:1
Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there:1
and a great number of priests sanctified themselves:1
But he perceived their craftiness:1
Yet had he the residue of the spirit:1
and what cities they be that they dwell in:1
These things did these three mightiest:1
and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean:1
neither be dismayed:3
at the south side southward:1
and to the river toward the great sea:1
as the manner of the Jews is to bury:1
and they prophesied also:1
Unto whom it was revealed:1
he will say:4
Michael and his angels fought against the dragon:1
Seek ye my face:1
And he provided the first part for himself:1
whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil:1
Thou shalt call me:1
Withhold not good from them to whom it is due:1
and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it:1
for a perpetual covenant:1
This shall not be thine heir:1
and bow myself before the high God:1
and with the flame of a devouring fire:1
being burdened:1
It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna:1
and will give it unto thee:1
and Maachah:1
the daughter of Herodias danced before them:1
or of he goats:1
and all that he had:6
and two small fishes:1
sakes:31
and into the land of Canaan they came:1
with Clement also:1
or have any ill blemish:1
and made thereunto a crown of gold round about:1
the sons of Aaron:26
I have written unto you:4
and they fought against it:1
and found the princes of Judah:1
who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel:1
Not purloining:1
and make thereto a crown of gold round about:1
And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant:1
but ye must foul the residue with your feet:1
were by their lot twelve cities:1
and over the asses was Jehdeiah the Meronothite:1
and wept sore:2
And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel:1
and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem:2
the family of the Jashubites:1
when one came to an heap of twenty measures:1
let thy word be verified:1
for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it:1
unto the children of thy people:2
and wouldest thou take away my son:1
And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath:1
the hills:43
in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten:1
And at the south side four thousand and five hundred measures:1
and bruises:1
even with two lines measured he to put to death:1
and Moses burnt the head:1
he is very proud:1
Enter not into the path of the wicked:1
Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David:1
besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus:1
Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place:1
And withal they learn to be idle:1
And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses:1
The son of Amzi:1
now the magicians of Egypt:1
will chastise you seven times for your sins:1
look not behind thee:1
and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself:1
so is a parable in the mouths of fools:1
she cried with a loud voice:1
to Baalah:2
the priests sprinkled the blood:2
and loving favour rather than silver and gold:1
why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land:1
to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit:1
And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue:1
and shall give it unto the priest with the holy thing:1
Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world:1
Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses:1
and Jamlech:1
Shemariah:3
and where thieves break through and steal:1
they went:156
and cast it beside the altar on the east part:1
Now the name of his firstborn was Joel:1
And a girdle of fine twined linen:1
but he shall surely be stoned:1
Ye shall drink no wine:1
In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island:1
and this is my friend:1
God hath spoken once:1
knowing that your Master also is in heaven:1
and against the south of the Kenites:1
thou makest it soft with showers:1
I shall be a lady for ever:1
and cutteth the spear in sunder:1
He that heareth:3
even the Reubenites:1
ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left:1
lest my people forget:1
and all your doings:1
they were astonished:7
the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field:1
because I did bear the reproach of my youth:1
and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart:1
Do ye not perceive:1
My LORD:2
s work of what sort it is:1
Even as I have seen:1
And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:1
suddenly shall he be broken without remedy:1
and hast cast me behind thy back:1
and at Hormah:1
and they found none:1
he called not:1
they have forsaken the LORD:2
There were also that said:1
and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal:1
that spread out their wings:1
the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah:1
to shew the people and the princes her beauty:1
Who is he that said:1
and condemn the wicked:1
and will bring them again to their folds:1
and in mercies:1
And it was made with cherubims and palm trees:1
thy wine mixed with water:1
Come out of her:1
and an hundred clusters of raisins:1
ye shall shoot forth your branches:1
and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land:1
Whose image and superscription hath it:1
and Rekem begat Shammai:1
quiet and secure:2
and it shall become a serpent:1
and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven:1
and leave a blessing behind him:1
Haman said moreover:1
and thy tabernacles:1
they gnashed upon me with their teeth:1
till we have drawn them from the city:1
Shammua the son of Zaccur:1
And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year:1
they shall lay their hand upon their mouth:1
did he not fear the LORD:1
but as it were foolishly:1
and let us go over to the Philistines:1
and be kept close:1
We acknowledge:1
and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee:1
And when Shaul was dead:1
and built forts against it round about:1
and cunning to work all works in brass:1
I speak the truth in Christ:1
and according to the fruit of his doings:2
went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon:1
and he do not whet the edge:1
we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:1
Give me my wives and my children:1
and their sin offering before the LORD:1
and he was the only officer which was in the land:1
Then prayed they him to tarry certain days:1
thy days approach that thou must die:1
to eat things sacrificed unto idols:2
and sanctify him:1
where many were gathered together praying:1
For in many things we offend all:1
and the robber swalloweth up their substance:1
or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters:1
and believed on Jesus:1
Do not sin against the child:1
O Judah:7
And the children of Dan went their way:1
and his hand took hold on Esau:1
So I went:2
Do not drink wine nor strong drink:1
in that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God:1
nor offence of heart unto my lord:1
and made them heads over the people:1
when he was come near to enter into Egypt:1
and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah:1
but polluted my sabbaths:1
and two cubits shall be the height thereof:1
Many daughters have done virtuously:1
and the gins of the workers of iniquity:1
and his beauty shall be as the olive tree:1
In the first month:4
Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt:1
for he had nine hundred chariots of iron:1
and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings:1
and the third day rise again:1
and hast given us such deliverance as this:1
he hath done that which is lawful and right:1
and make known to me the interpretation thereof:1
Whoso rewardeth evil for good:1
him will I blot out of my book:1
he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth:1
the holy city:9
Jesus was found alone:1
As is the earthy:1
and behold it together:1
David perceived that the child was dead:1
praise ye the LORD:1
and Anim:1
And all the cities of store that Solomon had:1
And from thence to Philippi:1
joined themselves:3
and yet I am not alone:1
Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath:1
nor figs on the fig tree:1
and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted:1
they judge not the cause:1
And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber:1
whose are these:2
and sworn by them that are no gods:1
for this day is holy unto our LORD:1
first being by interpretation King of righteousness:1
thou shalt not go unpunished:1
and behold a basket of summer fruit:1
neither his image:1
She hath killed her beasts:1
but that he will shew it me:1
that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice:1
that the poor may fall by his strong ones:1
for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee:1
and Edom:2
and a measuring reed:2
Afterwards the spirit took me up:1
certain sons of Belial:1
that he may live:3
rising early and protesting:1
into the south:1
which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast:1
for out of that well they watered the flocks:1
Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price:1
The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman:1
he hath also rejected thee from being king:1
and the table:6
and ye know:6
and drank thereof himself:1
is thy God:5
and worshipped him:12
let him be righteous still:1
that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ:1
and dwelt among us:1
Speak unto the priests the sons of Aaron:1
by the king of Assyria:1
and the chief men of the city:1
And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication:1
and waterest it:1
the son of Gedaliah:1
and Ziza:2
But when that which is perfect is come:1
if ye stand fast in the Lord:1
that he might bring us in:1
and drank of his own cup:1
if the witness be a false witness:1
And they also:2
and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen:1
And the son of an Israelitish woman:1
and have burned incense in it unto other gods:1
he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof:1
whose name was Manoah:1
Cherub:3
And they shall eat up thine harvest:1
wilt thou slay also a righteous nation:1
when it was weary:1
yielded up the ghost:3
therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings:1
he cometh leaping upon the mountains:1
after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing:1
And her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter:1
from the face of the serpent:1
The righteous is delivered out of trouble:1
Blessed are the undefiled in the way:1
And the other cherub was ten cubits:1
And unto Absalom there were born three sons:1
Thine are we:1
desiring greatly to see us:1
and Ram begat Amminadab:1
And she shall bring forth a son:1
Who also:6
and they came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts:1
and it shall be forgiven them:2
but believing:1
and sorrow:18
In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan:1
And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous:1
and tribute silver:1
but how little a portion is heard of him:1
For I will have respect unto you:1
Joseph my son is yet alive:1
for when thy judgments are in the earth:1
and the porters:9
Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah:1
nor of the will of man:1
there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife:1
but that all should come to repentance:1
and to serve other gods:1
With arrows and with bows shall men come thither:1
and setteth up his idols in his heart:1
the rebuke of thy God:1
I beheld till the thrones were cast down:1
and when they were come into the city:1
we would know therefore what these things mean:1
with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued:1
thou hast brought up my soul from the grave:1
and I make alive:1
but a fool layeth open his folly:1
it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire:2
The table of the LORD is polluted:1
and prophesy against him:2
And have tasted the good word of God:1
I will accept you with your sweet savour:1
And it was an hand breadth thick:1
when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:1
But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away:1
So all the cities for the children of Merari by their families:1
And Moses spake to the children of Israel:1
for the fear of the Jews fell upon them:1
yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:1
And this shall come to pass:1
And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things:1
being great with child:1
and his kingdom was full of darkness:1
but of a ready mind:1
Behold thy servant:1
Why sayest thou:1
they brought to him a man sick of the palsy:1
and the Philistines from Caphtor:1
Who is he that smote thee:1
and built cities for defence in Judah:1
and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast:1
So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come:1
who made heaven and earth:1
So Tamar went to her brother Amnon:1
and Elishama:1
except it were given unto him of my Father:1
Thou shalt not give me any thing:1
and fear:28
they shall climb the wall like men of war:1
for it is a shame for women to speak in the church:1
which are not of the cities of these nations:1
and let him dip his foot in oil:1
the family of the Tahanites:1
and cast him forth into the sea:1
and put his hand to his mouth:1
that it may be one:1
and cassia:1
which passeth knowledge:1
These nations are more than I:1
And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir:1
And Sarai said unto Abram:2
and he will plead with Israel:1
according to the power that worketh in us:1
And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the LORD:1
and had great reasoning among themselves:1
Bilgah:3
notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left:1
And came and preached peace to you which were afar off:1
and fell to the ground:1
and I will gather you from all the nations:1
and this house:3
Give us bread:1
and what I shall answer when I am reproved:1
because they were accursed:1
This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD:1
thou art gone up:1
that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor:1
Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh:1
and prove me now herewith:1
and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin:1
it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle:1
The righteous shall see it:1
the son of Ahasai:1
The Levites in the days of Eliashib:1
bring him hither to me:1
Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their armies:1
How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners:1
I will get me unto the great men:1
and offering him vinegar:1
wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life:1
and unto dust shalt thou return:1
Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall send against thee:1
I did blow upon it:1
and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine:1
and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them:1
and not forget thine handmaid:1
all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me:1
And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base:1
These were thy merchants in all sorts of things:1
and Chilmad:1
for a memorial in the temple of the LORD:1
thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew thee:1
if thou be willing:1
and stood before the king:3
so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance:1
and he fled to Lachish:1
For ye have the poor always with you:1
having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked:1
I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar:1
and all their victuals:1
my skin is broken:1
and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land:1
as dying:1
Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines:1
On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people:1
Shelomoth:2
Sit ye here:2
And they slew a bullock:1
And one of you say unto them:1
and none shall gather up him that wandereth:1
and the Levites:52
death can not celebrate thee:1
and brake:32
and his seven lamps thereon:1
and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them:1
and Sarai his daughter in law:1
s judgment hall:1
and all the vessels of the ministry:1
they made the breastplate double:1
and overlaid their chapiters:1
and with psalteries:1
and four hundred men with him:1
for reproof:1
the seventeenth day of the month:2
Turn from thy fierce wrath:1
Destroy not him with thy meat:1
and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD:1
Or if the raw flesh turn again:1
and shew Pharaoh:1
But they cried out:2
that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands:1
and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself:1
The sun to rule by day:1
who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him:1
who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians:1
and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun:1
and they shall be delivered into your hand:1
And Jesus answering said unto him:4
that he may go up from us:1
And the cloths of service:1
Eliel the chief:1
as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished:1
to give drink to my people:1
Then went he also to Ramah:1
and he judged Israel eight years:1
So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house:1
and in thy book all my members were written:1
that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath:1
let no man stay him:1
Because I go to the Father:1
Say:101
an hundred thirty and eight:1
and this shall be the higher place of the altar:1
Have not I chosen you twelve:1
and let her own works praise her in the gates:1
And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army:1
when I came to Troas to preach Christ:1
and to the king:9
I will afflict thee no more:1
wherewith they have reproached thee:1
that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart:1
His parents answered them and said:1
and utterly to make away many:1
The wise man:1
came to Ephesus:3
let them not despise them:1
therefore he slew him:1
Above all:1
and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy:1
So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty:1
into another country:1
that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:1
Then Peter:13
where there was no water:1
whose land the rivers have spoiled:2
cast ye up:1
my righteousness is in it:1
And as she was going to fetch it:1
and your fathers cried unto the LORD:1
I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee:1
and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD:1
none of us put off our clothes:1
and there was found no place for them:1
and to all his land:1
And the Levites that are gone away far from me:1
one baptism:1
plucked up by the roots:2
as the shaking of an olive tree:2
and let them seethe the bones of it therein:1
according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions:1
drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem:1
They are brought down and fallen:1
and gave them unto Abimelech:1
who seeing Jesus fell on his face:1
He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field:1
And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan:1
and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men:1
as with the people:1
when thou liest down:2
which he had taken from Haman:1
as for the world and the fulness thereof:1
they are together become unprofitable:1
and let us cast lots:1
that dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites:1
And he called his name Noah:1
And one told Jacob:1
as a child that is weaned of his mother:1
There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem:1
affliction shall not rise up the second time:1
to the oracle of the house:2
and was tempestuous against them:1
ready to distribute:1
But if we shall say:2
Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee:1
When they were by the house of Micah:1
If they shall fall away:1
and the LORD heard it:1
and I will send them:1
And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD:3
I have told you before:2
but I am slow of speech:1
to Abraham:41
and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy:1
And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground:1
Surely every man walketh in a vain shew:1
And Barak said unto her:1
all the flock will die:1
another of fishes:1
O LORD God of our fathers:1
for your burnt offerings:1
to build an altar unto the LORD:1
their brethren:60
and go unto thy tents:1
and the villages thereof:5
and more honourable than they:1
in whom I am well pleased:4
that as there was a readiness to will:1
and call for one Simon:1
and it shall return:1
and the flesh of captains:1
save our God:2
Strengthened with all might:1
Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us:1
and on camels:1
as ye are this day:1
and the priests took up the ark of the LORD:1
the servants of Jesus Christ:1
And they were exceeding sorry:1
was a boil:1
shall be holy unto the LORD:3
and for thy truth:2
Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel:1
even in all thy borders:1
and he dipped his finger in the blood:1
ye stouthearted:1
for it is nigh at hand:1
and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life:1
behold a multitude:1
insomuch that:16
And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar:1
and upon the new wine:1
he and all his army:1
that is a worm:1
Thou shalt neither vex a stranger:1
deliver my soul:3
He shall dwell on high:1
I thank my God upon every remembrance of you:1
be not afraid of the Assyrian:1
And the woman which thou sawest is that great city:1
So Samuel called unto the LORD:1
And say unto them:4
Now Barabbas was a robber:1
He made a pit:1
I thank thee that thou hast heard me:1
s which sent me:1
For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon:1
And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard:1
he whom thou lovest is sick:1
and his name shall be covered with darkness:1
And they took them:3
Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother:1
But he that had received one went and digged in the earth:1
for to the intent that I might shew them unto thee art thou brought hither:1
and Gatam:2
and is returned unto her father:1
and rent:6
James answered:1
saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his servant:1
nor for sacrifice:2
and yet thou hast not been as my servant David:1
and there is no respect of persons:1
and taketh not warning:1
but for you it is safe:1
For while they be folden together as thorns:1
and to take the spoil of them for a prey:2
and brake them to pieces:1
not doubletongued:1
Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee:1
he armed his trained servants:1
He deviseth mischief upon his bed:1
that he may declare unto us the riddle:1
And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate:1
or say unto him:1
Then the king said unto me:1
The plowers plowed upon my back:1
and deceive not with thy lips:1
and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid:1
and it had brightness round about:1
When he speaketh a lie:1
and in the sight of his servants:1
I will take away the posterity of Baasha:1
they fasten it with nails and with hammers:1
that the women came out of all cities of Israel:1
there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him:1
and rebelled against thee:1
When a few years are come:1
all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow:1
where is mine honour:1
And every one that hath forsaken houses:1
Let me depart:1
they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani:1
and the disciples to the multitude:2
being eighteen thousand men:1
for now:10
and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations:1
false witness:24
I raise up the Chaldeans:1
the son of Machir:4
specially of those that believe:1
And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD:1
s countenance:17
and make men go over dryshod:1
and instead of a girdle a rent:1
for thou exceedest the fame that I heard:1
And by the river upon the bank thereof:1
His foundation is in the holy mountains:1
and destroy thee from off the face of the earth:1
If thou believest with all thine heart:1
and there the weary be at rest:1
And I will feed the flock of slaughter:1
and the tribe of Judah was taken:1
in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour:1
another piece:5
And if she had at all an husband:1
and into the hand of those that seek their life:1
judge:317
And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief:1
And thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards:1
and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need:1
And the young man deferred not to do the thing:1
and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city:1
which made silver shrines for Diana:1
and perform my good word toward you:1
What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof:1
or have said to the fine gold:1
Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God:1
and the caul above the liver of the sin offering:1
Give counsel among you what we shall do:1
amen:120
neither have I commanded them:1
that thy profiting may appear to all:1
The woman was a Greek:1
neither light of the sun:1
it shall be an holy convocation unto you:1
And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods:1
and that night they caught nothing:1
O inhabitant of the earth:1
for who can tell him when it shall be:1
and none came in:1
and went forth toward Geliloth:1
And it shall be:57
Now will I praise the LORD:1
that the plague may be stayed from the people:2
for God is judge himself:1
lest they multiply:1
and their power was to hurt men five months:1
and plant gardens:2
until he be clean:1
as God had said unto him:1
let them relieve them:1
Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed:1
but when they have heard:1
and filled the bottle with water:1
As a mad man who casteth firebrands:1
but they shall not reign over thee:1
and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith:1
Who seeth us:1
when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali:1
I called him:2
that continue until night:1
shall suddenly come to his temple:1
Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly:1
Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines:1
which I have received of the Lord Jesus:1
and the children of Solomon:3
he looked up to heaven:1
and Akkub:2
not walking in craftiness:1
And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon:1
He that believeth on me hath everlasting life:1
and hearing they hear not:1
what shall thy wages be:1
Which my lips have uttered:1
for the rams:6
and which is in the valley of the giants on the north:1
s bones shall be burnt upon thee:1
and poured out drink offerings unto other gods:1
Shew us the Father:1
and a reproach:5
So Joab returned from the children of Ammon:1
But when the Comforter is come:1
thousand thousands ministered unto him:1
but righteousness:3
wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates:1
both the top of it:1
And Gaal spake again:1
the men of Gibeon:2
If David then call him Lord:1
for if I forgave any thing:1
and much people followed him:1
eternal life:26
it is a burning boil:1
And hope maketh not ashamed:1
This is the work of God:1
when they came to the house of the LORD which is at Jerusalem:1
thus he said:1
and offer them for an offering:2
The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee:1
And Naomi said unto her:3
now shall a month devour them with their portions:1
to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor:1
for I am poor and needy:1
If a man say:1
and I will give you rest:1
and to be beaten before his face:1
And his disciples answered him:1
The sons of Ham:1
bring my sons from far:1
put it far away:1
That this shall be no grief unto thee:1
so did the children of Israel unto them:1
saith the LORD the God of hosts:2
and the undersetters were of the very base itself:1
The oath which he sware to our father Abraham:1
But when Herod heard thereof:1
and go and feed them:1
He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root:1
And the apostles:5
and bring it within the vail:1
meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia:1
and they all shall wax old as doth a garment:1
and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel:1
and my face toward the ground:1
These six things doth the LORD hate:1
he shall not enter therein:1
Lift up thy voice:1
and they call together the whole band:1
which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out:1
We have no more but five loaves and two fishes:1
and shall bear his iniquity:1
here a little:4
but was in all points tempted like as we are:1
to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous:1
And the fish that is in the river shall die:1
They are all gone aside:1
I have gone astray like a lost sheep:1
and whose are these before thee:1
neither shall a man put on a woman:1
and the name of the other Medad:1
For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder:1
and plenteous in mercy:3
and we have brought it again in our hand:1
Wherefore I pray you to take some meat:1
Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel:1
And all the cities of the plain:1
s office in the sight of Aaron their father:1
and I am glorified in them:1
My soul fainteth for thy salvation:1
And he said unto his people:1
Set it by thee:1
and sin through ignorance:1
yet the Lord thinketh upon me:1
he distributed to the disciples:1
O ye nations:2
except their Rock had sold them:1
and found her dead:1
which cannot be removed:1
if he shall hear thee:1
And they brought him unto him:1
and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for:2
If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me:1
And go not after other gods to serve them:1
For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God:1
and the goings out of it shall be at Hazarenan:1
being warned of God of things not seen as yet:1
with their mattocks round about:1
the prophets and your rulers:1
And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel:1
The pastures are clothed with flocks:1
which I had given thee:1
And all the congregation of Judah:1
Because I said unto thee:1
roll a great stone unto me this day:1
to give us a reviving:1
And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee:1
O Samaria:1
and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this:1
wherefore should this city be laid waste:1
with the church that is in their house:1
and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead:1
And to them which were in Rachal:1
A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary:1
There shall the great owl make her nest:1
and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare:1
standeth in the house of Haman:1
by grace ye are saved:1

He discovereth deep things out of darkness:1
to cut off from it man and beast:2
affliction:87
And his disciples remembered that it was written:1
But the Pharisees said:1
which dwelleth between the cherubims:1
and a covering of badgers:1
forbearing threatening:1
If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee:1
and went to Geshur:2
and took an hammer in her hand:1
that I may send thee away:1
and I and my people are wicked:1
So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:1
he shall even break down their stone wall:1
Thine eye shall not pity him:1
s anger was kindled:10
Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people:1
And he came to Capernaum:1
hast not humbled thine heart:1
and he wrote them upon two tables of stone:1
And when Aaron saw it:1
And the sons of Bela:3
I have both glorified it:1
for your goodness is as a morning cloud:1
Which none of the princes of this world knew:1
and he cannot sin:1
O daughter of troops:1
then he wrote the dream:1
and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry:1
Philip and Bartholomew:1
And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem:1
were consumed:7
and the naughtiness of thine heart:1
and found Elisha the son of Shaphat:1
with Isaac:6
it is a leprosy:4
and shall know that I am the LORD:1
and they rebelled not against his word:1
and the glory of the LORD upon the house:1
So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD:1
because he could swear by no greater:1
it shall be eaten in the holy place:1
And Dishon:1
Yet lackest thou one thing:1
that he might loose him:1
let him not be circumcised:1
therefore they took a key:1
Israel is an empty vine:1
And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer:1
by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God:1
And when this epistle is read among you:1
and seek in the broad places thereof:1
but he that refuseth reproof erreth:1
that they die not:4
The beast that thou sawest was:1
and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation:1
Fear came upon me:1
And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him:1
Take the rod:1
And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel:1
and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant:1
and multitude of years should teach wisdom:1
from the end of heaven:1
not so much as to set his foot on:1
my days are extinct:1
And he gathered men unto him:1
I have slain the LORD:1
and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold:1
and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee:1
were four and forty thousand seven hundred and threescore:1
are ye angry at me:1
and sending:7
which knew his lord:1
and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard:1
Get thee to Anathoth:1
Then Sihon came out against us:1
which was shed from the foundation of the world:1
to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet:1
It is the king of Israel:1
And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king:1
And Judas the brother of James:1
and they took a stone:1
saying unto Abraham:1
the chief was Jehiel:1
if so be thou shalt be able to profit:1
Avenge me of mine adversary:1
and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of barley:1
And Judas and Silas:1
when the wall was built:1
and a pillar at the border thereof to the LORD:1
all of them uncircumcised:2
And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation:1
When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate:1
that may understand this:1
the things which God hath prepared for them that love him:1
prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy:1
he died unto sin once:1
and out of the middle into the third:1
Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength:1
which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king:1
s crumbs:1
and the people lamented:1
I sware unto thee:2
the king said unto the damsel:1
And he continued there a year and six months:1
who had seen all the great works of the LORD:1
or whether out of the body:1
and they shall no more be a prey:1
these be the dukes of Edom:1
For he mightily convinced the Jews:1
For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth:1
While Peter yet spake these words:1
and the mole:1
Joram his son:3
slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite:1
and unto Miriam:1
O ye:62
but God alone:1
And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim:1
and none shall open:2
Ahijah was over the treasures of the house of God:1
neither be thou confounded:1
and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab:1
and a chain on thy neck:1
and she bare him Ahban:1
but to this man will I look:1
the son of Azariah:4
Then the high priest rose up:1
And the sons of Reuben:1
which he had built in Samaria:1
Sanctify unto me all the firstborn:1
to work it in the blue:1
and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims:1
Give:82
Be not over much wicked:1
to avoid fornication:1
The great day of the LORD is near:1
and Socoh:1
he fell likewise upon his sword:1
and I have sent unto you:1
because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers:2
And I said unto the angel that talked with me:1
The ninth captain for the ninth month was Abiezer the Anetothite:1
and his eyes shall behold his eyes:1
these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom:1
And Jesus went about all Galilee:1
and in carving of timber:1
threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars:1
and cleanse the sanctuary:1
And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her:1
for salvation:4
and when ye turn to the left:1
Then Saul arose:1
because the LORD is his refuge:1
by hundreds:3
I forgave thee all that debt:1
and his coulter:1
and figs:1
that the LORD thy God is he which goeth over before thee:1
because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away:1
and went toward Haran:1
and shalt find nothing:1
Give us a king to judge us:1
And they began to be sorrowful:1
and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation:1
Fulfil ye my joy:1
the way toward the north:3
as the LORD hath said of the sons of David:1
For he knew that for envy they had delivered him:1
as of woollen and linen together:1
Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth:1
and the froward mouth:1
Zephi:1
And Hezekiah said:1
if they have kept my saying:1
which your own hands have made unto you for a sin:1
and Joatham begat Achaz:1
the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul:1
and came to battle:1
and there was none to help:2
and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God:1
even the fruit of their thoughts:1
was not my soul grieved for the poor:1
the proof of your love:1
hath given you treasure in your sacks:1
and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:1
and hast not withheld thy son:1
and with fasting:1
and a time of peace:1
and his owner also shall be put to death:1
For the life of the flesh is in the blood:1
Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah:1
And his mother said unto him:1
After him repaired also Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah:1
and they have none understanding:1
in the second year of Darius:4
but thou art a God ready to pardon:1
or wast thou made before the hills:1
Paarai the Arbite:1
Why is thy countenance sad:1
And both of these kings:1
he kept him as the apple of his eye:1
and many of the people also are fallen and dead:1
and who is Shechem:1
are we better than they:1
For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ:1
which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:1
but if thou wilt not go with me:1
and came unto Laish:1
went up straightway out of the water:1
It shall be unclean:1
until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies:1
And they taught in Judah:1
then they turned again:1
The earth is moved at the noise of their fall:1
and all work of goats:1
if they be shaken:1
as without law:1
until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God:1
On the tenth day Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai:1
And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem:1
The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations:1
But these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day:1
Simon the Canaanite:2
so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men:1
How shall I put thee among the children:1
like the work of the ephod:1
But the king covered his face:1
And their father said unto them:1
if the rising of the sore be white reddish in his bald head:1
And they cast lots:2
And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem:1
for they wist not what it was:1
Hattush:5
Hear ye the words of the great king:1
so they wrap it up:1
there is a people come out of Egypt:1
For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man:1
for I bear you record:1
and thou hast said in thine heart:1
throughout all generations:4
And the Philistines took the ark of God:1
and with all other:1
For length of days:1
because Gibeon was a great city:1
and ye shall be my sons and daughters:1
that Israel prevailed:1
he came out of him:2
And those men said unto him:1
so that thou art not able to carry it:1
and sealeth their instruction:1
as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God:1
and pursued after him seven days:1
and the hands of all the people:1
but did not utterly drive them out:1
The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return:1
and stayed there until now:1
The word of the LORD came unto me:4
because he will not ever be threshing it:1
And the king of Sodom said unto Abram:1
for he will not have sodden flesh of thee:1
being:277
And he will appoint him captains over thousands:1
The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach:1
Korah his son:1
which was the son of Phalec:1
to the end they might not live:1
and write it:3
every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them:1
in the land of Judah:11
the LORD of all the earth:3
are all things:5
and life unto the bitter in soul:1
That saith:3
And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:1
and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them:1
that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence:1
And I heard another voice from heaven:1
it also is gone from me:1
Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand:1
having a live coal in his hand:1
that he may have mercy upon you:2
and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat:1
And I will make all my mountains a way:1
and to build it in three days:1
They have dealt treacherously against the LORD:1
unto the testimony of Israel:1
and Amraphel king of Shinar:1
Give your cattle:1
therefore glorify God in your body:1
and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon:1
and they dealt not treacherously with thee:1
and Israel pursued them:1
where she hath a place prepared of God:1
that they might take him:1
that the enemy hath reproached:1
that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still:1
and the hills shall flow with milk:1
for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them:1
s commandments:44
princes also shall worship:1
And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year:1
and chased them unto great Zidon:1
that we might enquire of him:2
and he was in his presence:1
and maketh collops of fat on his flanks:1
and this life is in his Son:1
be unto our God for ever and ever:1
and the chief of the fathers of Israel:1
and we will draw it into the river:1
but every man:7
and with him will I abide:1
and for all that shall be done therein:1
Joseph will peradventure hate us:1
and the spoil:9
and thus did he unto them:1
it hath been already of old time:1
and took a great stone:1
that it may be on the bread for a memorial:1
even our faith:1
and prosperity within thy palaces:1
and delivered him again to his father:1
And the sons of Ishi were:1
and burning instead of beauty:1
and Zerah:3
and for all his freewill offerings:1
for the LORD hath added grief to my sorrow:1
For not the hearers of the law are just before God:1
She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life:1
therefore I cast forth all the household stuff to Tobiah out of the chamber:1
The LORD hath done that which he had devised:1
which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites:1
And also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise:1
And there shall be:14
And when he heard this:1
which he did to you and to your fathers:1
And he did evil in the sight of the LORD:3
and laid them on the fire:1
And Saul said unto him:1
king of Salem:2
Grant thee according to thine own heart:1
times:155
and the sun ashamed:1
O our God:4
for she was of the age of twelve years:1
playing the harlot:2
according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel:1
beware of the concision:1
lest the land become desolate:1
even to the children of Heth:1
and formeth the spirit of man within him:1
one shall then open him the gate that looketh toward the east:1
shewing himself through the lattice:1
Depart in peace:1
and from the appearance of his loins even downward:1
And Cain said unto the LORD:1
shall I praise you in this:1
and have no son:1
and he abode there two days:1
and his servants shall serve him:1
and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage:1
And the breadth of the court on the east side eastward shall be fifty cubits:1
and there shall he be until I visit him:1
who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:1
s hammer:1
an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary:1
he abideth at Jerusalem:1
in the king:54
Then was the king:2
And the arches thereof were toward the utter court:1
Not that any man hath seen the Father:1
And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies:1
And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue:1
s wisdom:29
they were full of wrath:1
because he hath thrown down his altar:1
and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters:1
and smote them:11
after they went forth:1
Will he plead against me with his great power:1
Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place:1
is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon:1
from the hill that lieth before Bethhoron southward:1
Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven:1
These words spake Jesus:2
in the day of thy fall:2
And he sailed from Ephesus:1
Lest when thou hast eaten and art full:1
and our iniquities:1
The Master saith unto thee:1
destroy not thy people and thine inheritance:1
take ye every man for them which are in his tents:1
and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:1
then ye shall kill him:1
s company departed:1
Not a novice:1
and led him out of the town:1
for he thought:2
And the king said unto Araunah:1
I trust in thee:1
and to cast it unto the dogs:1
Hast thou not known:1
And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams:1
and also with men:1
Whoso is wise:1
your young men shall see visions:2
therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head:1
if any man serve me:1
In God will I praise his word:1
ye chariots:1
without wrath and doubting:1
a perfect and just measure shalt thou have:1
and sat under the booths:1
which was at Ashtaroth:1
that they might have hold:1
And she said unto her father:1
and they shall never perish:1
because they had understood the words that were declared unto them:1
s servants:182
for the Holy Ghost was not yet given:1
and from thence they sailed to Cyprus:1
He hath made the earth by his power:2
I will do as thou hast said:1
archers:12
I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul:1
O Lemuel:1
but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable:1
The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire:1
And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery:1
for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD:1
and rescued him:1
After the number of the days in which ye searched the land:1
And David said unto him:6
at every place whither we shall come:1
And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon:1
Shammah:8
and he numbered them from twenty years old and above:1
so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God:1
he led captivity captive:1
And a voice came out of the throne:1
And I will not have mercy upon her children:1
What have we spoken so much against thee:1
So there was gathered much people together:1
not seeing the sun for a season:1
and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:1
and Enhazor:1
He first findeth his own brother Simon:1
And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjathjearim:1
Whosoever shall read this writing:1
In that night did God appear unto Solomon:1
and the things which are therein:1
that say in their heart:1
And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration:1
This generation shall not pass:2
of Shillem:1
Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god:1
his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness:1
it is for the sword:1
whose sister:1
And Gideon said:6
There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem:1
and their sockets four:1
from the sword:11
Wherein have we robbed thee:1
I will also make it a possession for the bittern:1
Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD:1
He said moreover:3
O ye servants of the LORD:2
to the threshold of the house:1
if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel:1
Greet them that be of the household of Narcissus:1
Jairus by name:1
after that he hath taken away the stones:1
and his basons:1
The saying is good:1
but what are they among so many:1
or that is in the waters beneath the earth:1
out of Machir came down governors:1
shall be a fading flower:1
and Elpalet:1
my commandments:30
was not this my saying:1
the Almighty:44
of the asses:3
and they of the plain the Philistines:1
and protested unto thee:1
Which devour widows:2
therefore stood they before the king:1
keep sound wisdom and discretion:1
let them shout from the top of the mountains:1
s work shall be burned:1
who loveth to have the preeminence among them:1
know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand:1
and that ye should minister unto him:1
and they stand as a garment:1
and thou hast not found her:1
my servants shall rejoice:1
and their pins:2
I will punish them:3
Except your youngest brother come down with you:1
the son of Phinehas:3
And thirty and six thousand beeves:1
and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way:1
I will make thee small among the heathen:1
and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver:1
where is the house that ye build unto me:1
And shall come forth:1
And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him:1
The sons of Judah were Er and Onan:1
And these are the families of the Levites according to their fathers:1
and thou shalt beat in pieces many people:1
And David put them off him:1
and the land of Nephthalim:1
Be ye therefore ready also:1
nor the smell of fire had passed on them:1
and also before thee:1
whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel:1
But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants:1
and overtake thee:3
To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee:1
and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua:1
their princes:10
and break me in pieces with words:1
if any man minister:1
to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD:1
I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver:1
Ishbosheth Saul:2
to betray him:4
with all the young lions thereof:1
for I have delivered it into thine hand:1
and unto all Egypt:1
rending it in pieces:1
and bear thy shame:1
and they shall walk with me in white:1
Let thine hand help me:1
and to chasten thyself before thy God:1
thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death:1
but her voice was not heard:1
I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception:1
and be a goodly cedar:1
that all men through him might believe:1
Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem:1
the son of Abdi:3
And they led Jesus away to the high priest:1
of whom the greater part remain unto this present:1
to eat sufficiently:1
If we have sown unto you spiritual things:1
in the ears of all the men of Shechem:2
s anointed is before him:1
Paul preached unto them:1
Intreat the LORD:2
and with his Son Jesus Christ:1
the horns thereof shall be of the same:1
in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria:1
What saith my Lord unto his servant:1
from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt:1
The day is thine:1
And Joab said unto him:1
a goodly price that I was prised at of them:1
My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times:1
a time of war:1
the son of Eliashib the high priest:1
I change not:1
So Joshua rose up early in the morning:1
when the brethren heard of us:1
Moreover Ruth the Moabitess:1
For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout:1
Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured:1
and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also:1
and the battle bow shall be cut off:1
When he was gone out:1
I will remember the works of the LORD:1
And her mother in law said unto her:1
Thou shalt sell me meat for money:1
For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away:1
John answered:6
And there came a certain poor widow:1
whether pipe or harp:1
or whether we be comforted:1
O mountains:3
which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets:1
Jerimoth the son of Azriel:1
before he die:2
that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey:1
but he himself stayed in Asia for a season:1
they shall not be lamented:2
And he brought forth the people that were therein:1
and walked after things that do not profit:1
With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful:2
To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs:1
and he kissed them:1
and shalt not find them:1
as they sat at the table:1
drink:393
O vine of Sibmah:1
Because there were no graves in Egypt:1
And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses:1
peace be on them:1
that Jesus had said unto him:1
Blessed is he that considereth the poor:1
and casteth silver chains:1
We have borrowed money for the king:1
And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house:1
but if thou canst do any thing:1
gird you with sackcloth:3
and uncircumcised in flesh:1
but the righteous are bold as a lion:1
my sheaf arose:1
then make them rulers over my cattle:1
and receive my sayings:1
The children of Azgad:2
Then he saith:1
fell sick:4
or putteth it under a bed:1
but I have not forgotten thy law:1
which hath been with me these days:1
They set their mouth against the heavens:1
and his righteousness:6
can I bring him back again:1
for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her:1
Publish in the palaces at Ashdod:1
For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words:1
or a goat:1
And Balaam went with Balak:1
And they lodged round about the house of God:1
thou wast a God that forgavest them:1
leth:324
and it be loathsome unto you:1
for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness:1
and bring me him up:1
Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles:1
and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the LORD:1
therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom:1
For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken:1
if now I have found favour in thy sight:1
blasting:5
This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee:1
she went into captivity:1
Thou shalt not kill:4
we know that we all have knowledge:1
therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars:1
but they will not hearken to thee:1
an hundred twenty and seven provinces:1
What manner of saying is this that he said:1
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all:4
it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid:1
That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ:1
and the door:5
he began to eat:1
and that soul shall be cut off from among his people:2
So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten:1
for the LORD hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath:1
Many sorrows shall be to the wicked:1
because he was wroth:2
and the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:1
The horseleach hath two daughters:1
and there wasted his substance with riotous living:1
And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people:1
I will give all these countries:1
Salute Philologus:1
Laadan:7
Shall even he that hateth right govern:1
thou didst well that it was in thine heart:1
But what have I done:1
I do send thee unto them:1
such as he can get:1
my land is before thee:1
whether it be good or bad:5
so are their houses full of deceit:1
for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand:1
with the voice together shall they sing:1
and surely we shall be stronger than they:2
And thou shalt be brought down:1
And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle:1
the son of Shimei:2
and because ye have sinned against the LORD:1
ye commit sin:1
and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous:1
This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to their families:1
that I may consume them in a moment:1
let him answer it:1
one principal household being taken for Eleazar:1
We remember the fish:1
of gold and silver:6
Then one said unto him:1
and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate:1
all that come into the tent:1
Ye have sinned a great sin:1
let him kill me:1
None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him:1
let him not approach to offer the bread of his God:1
Hadoram also:1
according to the first time:1
and sowed in his field:1
and they shall be an execration:1
which is builded with great stones:1
And these are the garments which they shall make:1
Then say thou:1
And they shall build the old wastes:1
And Hezron begat Ram:1
Blessed be the LORD thy God:3
and he took her:1
that every one that findeth me shall slay me:1
I will be thy king:1
And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you:1
he groaned in the spirit:1
s brink against he come:1
which rode upon camels:1
And I sought for a man among them:1
prophesy unto my people Israel:1
Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands:1
for I am as ye are:1
and killing:3
O Lord GOD of hosts:1
into the fire that never shall be quenched:2
and the third part of the sea became blood:1
Thus saith thy brother Israel:1
conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood:1
Who brought thee hither:1
and he that hath not:2
and came to David to Hebron:1
And he went down:3
And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus:1
forgive me this wrong:1
and the fire shall devour them:1
for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman:1
So being affectionately desirous of you:1
unmoveable:2
But to which of the angels said he at any time:1
They shall lick the dust like a serpent:1
skins that is above upon it:1
according to the years of an hireling:1
Also day by day:1
for men abhorred the offering of the LORD:1
And the smoke of the incense:1
But Martha was cumbered about much serving:1
Then thou shalt see:1
a thousand and seven hundred:3
and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene:1
that useth his neighbour:1
They clave to their brethren:1
Of Gad:1
Now these are the priests and the Levites that went up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel:1
Hezrai the Carmelite:1
and they stood still in the prison gate:1
which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah:1
And he went out to meet Asa:1
And Moses made a serpent of brass:1
together with the daughter of Pharaoh:1
and he in whom I trust:1
and he will make her wilderness like Eden:1
And after a time he returned to take her:1
Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD:1
these are the beginnings of sorrows:1
Wherefore his servants said unto him:1
and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:1
and I am but a little child:1
and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent:1
so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them:1
For if I pray in an unknown tongue:1
or of the new moon:1
and the answer of the tongue:1
Whose mouth speaketh vanity:1
let the daughters of Judah be glad:1
and the ark went upon the face of the waters:1
And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him:1
when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath:1
which went out:4
Therefore say I unto you:1
Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever:1
the Amorite:83
let her be covered:1
and caves:2
and were come to him out of every city:1
Boast not thyself of to morrow:1
Hear the words of thine handmaid:1
I will give them flesh:1
s house three months:2
and the inhabitants thereof an hissing:1
and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite:1
and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son:1
whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:1
for your work shall be rewarded:1
The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee:1
to keep thee:3
to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north:1
and brake down the wall of Jerusalem:2
Shall it be told him that I speak:1
Now thou art commanded:1
and on mine arm shall they trust:1
Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age:1
and he looked that it should bring forth grapes:1
Adam:33
Entice him:1
O faithless generation:1
s side:73
and destroy your cattle:1
and the heavens dropped:1
Ye shall eat nothing leavened:1
and let us play the men for our people:1
Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering:1
and brought away their cattle:1
And also the burnt offerings were in abundance:1
and for all manner of pleasant jewels:1
behold with thine eyes:2
also the LORD hath said unto me:1
for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy:1
For all that is in the world:1
with the measuring reed round about:2
ye remnant of Judah:2
and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold:1
I know all the fowls of the mountains:1
to live after the flesh:1
putting it on her shoulder:1
The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne:1
And I will give peace in the land:1
But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age:1
and remain in their places:1
for your redemption draweth nigh:1
they shall fall in this wilderness:1
even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ:1
And hereby we do know that we know him:1
And as it was in the days of Noe:1
and for his household:1
on the eighth day thou shalt give it me:1
and it shall devour all round about him:1
save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite:1
Their brethren also the Levites were appointed unto all manner of service of the tabernacle of the house of God:1
and at Bethphelet:1
Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:3
The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him:1
And the law is not of faith:1
They shall offer their offering:1
And when David heard of it:2
the daughter of Zechariah:1
One of the two which heard John speak:1
born at Alexandria:1
or gather together:1
and he abhorred Israel:1
But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings:1
that he might fill all things:1
and a span the breadth thereof:1
or as one of the prophets:1
which indeed appear beautiful outward:1
as one goeth to Hamath:1
and found many that were come together:1
lovest thou me more than these:1
And he taught them many things by parables:1
we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:1
For all those things hath mine hand made:1
If thy children have sinned against him:1
but ye shall be ashamed:1
within the temple:1
all these things worketh God oftentimes with man:1
and his judgments:9
But when his heart was lifted up:1
Didst not thou:1
ye shall see my face no more:1
But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him:1
let him send unto his servants:1
even he shall die in his iniquity:1
even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover:2
where is the garrison of the Philistines:1
which was slain in the day of the plague for Peor:1
and of the south:3
And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah:1
I am against your pillows:1
Their children also shall be as aforetime:1
By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines:1
for it is great:2
I will praise him among the multitude:1
and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth:1
your bodies to bodies of clay:1
that God hath made man upright:1
And he said unto his disciples:1
they say unto him:3
when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased:1
and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee:1
but he blesseth the habitation of the just:1
and troubled them in building:1
he saith unto his mother:1
from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon:1
s inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth:1
by profaning the covenant of our fathers:1
and took unto him his wife:1
they poured out a prayer when thy chastening was upon them:1
that God had prepared the people:1
Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly:1
and he saveth them out of their distresses:1
And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war:1
and thy path in the great waters:1
that shall consume the eyes:1
but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession:1
Then were there brought unto him little children:1
men passed by:1
and of cattle after their kind:1
and the king of Zeboiim:1
And be ready in the morning:1
These things spake Jesus:1
and one hundred thousand talents of iron:1
And they journeyed from Oboth:1
and also his coat:1
and emptied:3
Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly:1
And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city:1
that ye should be married to another:1
Then were the men exceedingly afraid:1
and did eat:18
As many were astonied at thee:1
both out of the plain country round about Jerusalem:1
and on the set feasts:1
even as the LORD my God commanded me:1
And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years:1
When I would comfort myself against sorrow:1
and they shall condemn him to death:2
and also with him that is not here with us this day:1
my honour is nothing:1
and take up the fish that first cometh up:1
and Joseph and his mother knew not of it:1
I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me:1
whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching:1
A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD:1
for I have chosen thee:1
and his two wives also:1
and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made:1
that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem:1
We have mortgaged our lands:1
they said unto us ten times:1
as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates:1
for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts:1
when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it:1
when the time was come that he should be received up:1
thy name is from everlasting:1
and flee into Egypt:1
God shall judge the righteous and the wicked:1
Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt:1
and the outgoings of it were at the sea:1
that ye may be tried:1
appeared unto me:5
of linen:3
neither hadst pleasure therein:1
but our eyes are upon thee:1
Ye serpents:1
our eye hath seen it:1
Declare unto us this parable:1
which brought thee out of the land of Egypt:3
How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD:1
When he was come down from the mountain:1
by my God have I leaped over a wall:2
to exhortation:1
A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool:1
s colt unto the choice vine:1
and they came to the battle:1
His countenance was like lightning:1
from morning till evening:1
Let your moderation be known unto all men:1
and thou shalt be desolate:1
that when the Jews which dwelt by them came:1
he that hath a purse:1
and called me by his grace:1
He that walketh uprightly walketh surely:1
for they have rebelled against thee:1
that I might shew these my signs before him:1
No prophet is accepted in his own country:1
When the heaven is shut up:1
One that ruleth well his own house:1
Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah:1
All the days of his separation he is holy unto the LORD:1
were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword:1
and their abominations which they have committed:1
Nicodemus answered and said unto him:1
which had kept his bed eight years:1
And sitting down they watched him there:1
and when she saw him that he was a goodly child:1
but thou shalt follow me afterwards:1
and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger:1
It was never so seen in Israel:1
and he passed through the land of the Benjamites:1
they have made them a molten calf:1
And the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day:1
Then the king arose:3
False witnesses did rise up:1
I will meditate also of all thy work:1
I have lifted up mine hand:1
There were also women looking on afar off:1
this is acceptable with God:1
The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands:1
and will give them to be removed and spoiled:1
and her daughters shall be burned with fire:1
then I will pay for it:1
in the house of God:11
O ye sons of men:2
and lie not against the truth:1
to fulfil the word of God:1
our brother:24
and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me:1
the daughter of Judah:3
before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk:1
and thou preservest them all:1
her mistress was despised in her eyes:1
He saith unto them:6
that such should be stoned:1
the God of thy father:6
and called his name Seth:2
And when he had spoken this word unto me:1
and his branch:5
Then shalt thou say in thine heart:1
For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God:1
He was with David at Pasdammim:1
and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth:1
And afterward:15
My lips shall not speak wickedness:1
thou shalt be dumb:2
and made also molten images for Baalim:1
and upon the border round about:1
The place is too strait for me:1
yet I destroyed his fruit from above:1
And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah:1
Hope deferred maketh the heart sick:1
O king of Judah:1
as the families of the countries:1
Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house:1
and the cities are walled:1
and consumed him:1
It is said:1
Neither shall ye build house:1
Give God the praise:1
and Eliel:5
and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him:1
and were confounded:1
and they were sore afraid:2
And the high priest arose:1
by day time in a pillar of a cloud:1
and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:1
Thus shall Babylon sink:1
whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan:1
were hangings of fifteen cubits:1
then shall the prophet be known:1
and of treading down:1
and the breadth five and twenty cubits:3
And when they had brought them:1
And as they were afraid:1
and their fat:7
And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock:1
came:2149
So Manasseh slept with his fathers:1
and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you:1
with James and John:2
and with a girdle of a skin about his loins:1
the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart:1
This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth:1
even all the children of Israel:1
seeing I go whither I may:1
and scattereth the sheep:1
and followed other gods:1
Far be it:2
Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew:1
that is upon the bank of the river Arnon:1
when I would do good:1
even as the Lord gave to every man:1
which were not my people:2
Prepare thy chariot:1
the armourbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah:1
your sheaves stood round about:1
and I will pray for you unto the LORD:1
which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim:1
because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam:1
and would have eaten:1
take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men:1
and the true light now shineth:1
and none shall fray them away:1
The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more:1
he saddled his ass:1
Or if there be any flesh:1
and bring him low:1
that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:1
for a sweet savour unto me:1
Hell is naked before him:1
for Shemaiah:1
he layeth it on his shoulders:1
And Husham died:1
And he cried:8
and on the north side two thousand cubits:1
as ye have spoken in mine ears:1
and when ye are gathered together within your cities:1
and kept not his testimonies:1
as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn:1
and I will glorify thy name for evermore:1
And when I come:1
both old and young:1
for he had not proved it:1
And when he was alone:1
or wrinkle:1
adulteries:5
s daughter said to her:1
and which entereth into that within the veil:1
And when he hath taken away the multitude:1
drew him out of the city:1
neither any thing hid:1
of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat:1
therefore shall ye flee:1
The first man Adam was made a living soul:1
and sprinkled it upon Aaron:1
And Jethro said to Moses:1
after ye have done the will of God:1
And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest:2
take heed that ye be not consumed one of another:1
their young ones shall lie down together:1
The name of the first is Pison:1
and the land shall yield her increase:1
shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand:1
Zidonians:9
I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth:1
The burden of Nineveh:1
and in a pillar of fire by night:1
and he begetteth a son:1
But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines:1
and go to the mount of the Amorites:1
And he that betrayed him had given them a token:1
knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation:1
They shall look on him whom they pierced:1
But as he went the people thronged him:1
What shall we do to these men:1
then they journeyed:2
he shall surely be put to death:5
and with musical instruments of God:1
why is he spoiled:1
as the scorpions of the earth have power:1
and fall backward:1
seeing ye know these things before:1
The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever:1
Breach for breach:1
signifying what death he should die:2
five lambs of the first year:12
ye are my bones and my flesh:1
Then shall the lambs feed after their manner:1
and they sewed fig leaves together:1
For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit:1
my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity:1
and fear thy God:1
Rejoice not against me:1
for their worm shall not die:1
even the man Gabriel:1
neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest:1
my lord also hath our herds of cattle:1
when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt:1
and overcame them:1
from generation to generation it shall lie waste:1
and Jeremiah:9
My soul is among lions:1
and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath:1
And he had forty sons and thirty nephews:1
and an ephah to a ram:1
on the side of the tabernacle southward:2
Their houses are safe from fear:1
unto the glory and praise of God:1
foolishness:19
Buy thee the field for money:1
The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children:1
Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah:1
thinketh no evil:1
and the houses were not builded:1
as an ox goeth to the slaughter:1
and they came into the land of Goshen:1
I sought the LORD:1
shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth them:1
And he took thereof in his hands:1
he shall come into the camp again:1
but ye cannot tell whence I come:1
And ye shall be my people:1
then thou wilt hear and help:1
but will flee from him:1
And the harp:1
and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people:1
for the living God:2
and we smote them:1
and he followeth not us:1
Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon:1
And Jonathan said unto David:2
which had the inkhorn by his side:1
fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up:1
Plead with your mother:1
Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city:1
and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years:1
that we may live:3
and the swallow a nest for herself:1
and the heart of kings is unsearchable:1
there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand:1
These are they whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth:1
even so be he with Solomon:1
If any man or woman that believeth have widows:1
under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship:1
with all trees of frankincense:1
and thou art exalted as head above all:1
and for the great abundance of thine enchantments:1
With the ancient is wisdom:1
and the LORD was with them:1
And Jacob rose up early in the morning:1
though it be tried with fire:1
putting on the breastplate of faith and love:1
sacrificing unto the calves that he had made:1
and the violent take it by force:1
is not his mother called Mary:1
So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD:1
And the LORD spake to Manasseh:1
wherefore do ye tempt the LORD:1
and I saw vanity under the sun:1
O foolish people and unwise:1
who is able to save and to destroy:1
for he shall be king in my stead:1
that I might live unto God:1
to offer for sins:1
this have I found:1
or he is in a journey:1
and the staves thereof:4
We ought to obey God rather than men:1
for ye have turned judgment into gall:1
then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand:1
And I will cast thee out:1
when thou shalt receive thy sisters:1
and slew the men of Ai:1
and laws:4
Of whom we have many things to say:1
among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God:1
both to abound and to suffer need:1
So they came and stood before the king:1
But now it is come upon thee:1
that thou shalt be dumb:1
thou hast made heaven:2
After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you:1
with all the land of Naphtali:1
And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true:1
sake thou didst not utterly consume them:1
I the LORD have deceived that prophet:1
They are come from a far country unto me:1
yet I will not make a full end of thee:1
understand the words that I speak unto thee:1
and his mattock:1
Amariah the second:2
these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families:1
Let not then your good be evil spoken of:1
and he requested for himself that he might die:1
Fight neither with small nor great:1
the plague hath not spread in the house:1
and he that eateth not:1
they stand up together:1
And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand:1
and find them so:1
and ye have said unto him:1
and brought unto him all that were diseased:1
and the trespass offering:3
and shalt eat there:1
to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth:1
And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah:1
he took me:2
Or what man is there of you:1
whither I go:4
For now will I break his yoke from off thee:1
Go up to Lebanon:1
it will come to nought:1
and kill:29
Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap:1
and others with them:1
when I should find thee without:1
thou art God alone:1
that say:20
Neither shall one thrust another:1
And there was also a strife among them:1
ye backsliding children:1
that they should not hear:2
and I will place them in their houses:1
of Ahab the son of Kolaiah:1
But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not:1
and make about them walls:1
reap in mercy:1
which were in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid:1
and blessing:2
the LORD will give grace and glory:1
And of the children of the priests:1
that stood by:17
then after that the children of Israel journeyed:1
If a man die:3
as it was shewed thee in the mount:1
at the brook of Kison:1
Art thou better than populous No:1
hath not the house of Israel:1
because his strength is great:1
according to the vow which he vowed:1
and ye shall find rest for your souls:1
and their envy:1
Go home to thy friends:1
that they may eat a whole month:1
for God now accepteth thy works:1
Therefore say unto the house of Israel:2
I will not ask:1
and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea:1
In four quarters were the porters:1
And this oblation of the land that is offered shall be unto them a thing most holy by the border of the Levites:1
nor of uncleanness:1
but is in danger of eternal damnation:1
if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee:1
it is graven upon the table of their heart:1
for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not:1
he saw a man which was blind from his birth:1
for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter:1
And on the morrow Peter went away with them:1
for Jesus had conveyed himself away:1
dost thou steal:1
then Kedar:1
and my work with my God:1
they are given us to consume:1
the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about:1
until it was a great host:1
And he that sent me is with me:1
every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold:1
Which Shelomith and his brethren were over all the treasures of the dedicated things:1
And the remnant of the sodomites:1
and the daughter against the mother:1
and shall go with whirlwinds of the south:1
Uriah the Hittite:10
Their visage is blacker than a coal:1
And I knew him not:2
according to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me:1
and their brasen sockets twenty:1
So run:1
and for our iniquities have we:1
and they shall fight against it:1
Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge:1
cause thy belly to eat:1
so are the branches:1
because we have heard reproach:1
that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me:1
And when they were gone out of the city:1
and received instruction:1
one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law:1
which will not be charmed:1
Their enemies also oppressed them:1
Is Christ divided:1
and shall be in you:1
there is none good but one:2
they would exclude you:1
and take of the ancients of the people:1
I am not:51
And the king of Babylon smote them:1
establish the decree:1
the same shall be last of all:1
s concubines:6
I see your father:1
And seekest thou great things for thyself:1
and the box together:1
And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar:1
which ye shall appoint for the manslayer:1
Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city:1
and when he saw him:4
which say:11
and greater works than these shall he do:1
And Zelophehad the son of Hepher had no sons:1
that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always:1
but have done after the manners of the heathen that are round about you:1
should she not be ashamed seven days:1
and burn this city with fire:1
And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod:1
Do ye not yet understand:1
to my law:2
it is a statute for ever unto the LORD:1
shake the hand:1
and they that are with him are called:1
she communed with him of all that was in her heart:2
and purify thyself with them:1
By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee:1
the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant:1
unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning:1
that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:1
also thou hast delivered thy soul:1
And they sat down in ranks:1
until the days be fulfilled:1
and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem:2
and that there is black hair grown up therein:1
and the LORD will not hear you in that day:1
Obadiah:20
And he took and sent messes unto them from before him:1
and divers also of the princes of Israel:1
And they shall call them:1
Woe to Ariel:1
and the man that bare the shield went before him:1
But if ye had known what this meaneth:1
As for man:1
reconciling the world unto himself:1
Ye are gods:2
and die therefore:1
Because the daughters of Zion are haughty:1
obeying the commandments of the LORD:1
and that ye may increase mightily:1
There is nothing:4
all the people will stone us:1
bring them down unto the water:1
for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth:1
And the families of the scribes which dwelt at Jabez:1
when they shall look after them:1
with the border before Japho:1
Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time:1
he gave commandment to depart unto the other side:1
to serve him with one consent:1
your own sword hath devoured your prophets:1
and of every living creature that moveth in the waters:1
and all the people of war with him:2
and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales:1
so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers:1
and against the Chaldeans:1
But the fig tree said unto them:1
the place was shaken where they were assembled together:1
and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon:1
Bring forth the best robe:1
No man can come to me:1
and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart:1
that he let the children of Israel go out of his land:1
And Hiram sent in the navy his servants:1
And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne:1
and thus it was:1
and not return:1
rising up a great while before day:1
together:508
and in brick:1
that he rent his clothes:4
And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay:1
he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah:1
they did not stand:1
For our soul is bowed down to the dust:1
s word prevailed against Joab:2
They answered him:3
lest ye should be wise in your own conceits:1
the son of Michaiah:1
all ye people:7
and buy one:1
but Magormissabib:1
kiss my father and my mother:1
And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt:1
Keep me:3
yet among many nations was there no king like him:1
a people which I knew not shall serve me:1
which is over against the going up of Adummim:1
All things come alike to all:1
and them that worshipped his image:1
and with an high arm brought he them out of it:1
Now when Pharaoh heard this thing:1
let her breasts satisfy thee at all times:1
hold that fast which thou hast:1
he shall wound the heads over many countries:1
I restore him fourfold:1
These things are good and profitable unto men:1
to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart:1
that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee:1
s master took him:1
singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord:1
Then said God:1
for their king shall go into captivity:1
and be clear when thou judgest:1
And they murmured against her:1
thou shalt diligently consider his place:1
but speak not:1
to be in my sanctuary:1
who shall offer that which is for the sin offering first:1
When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee:1
and it shall stand for ever:1
that he should lie:1
Wherefore dost thou prophesy:1
and Bethanath:1
which did corrupt the earth with her fornication:1
from the midst of the furnace of iron:1
and he judged Israel ten years:1
and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem:1
by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem:1
And I brought you into the land of the Amorites:1
and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem:2
And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day that it was anointed:1
and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine:1
It is even a vapour:1
that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer:1
when he had found a young ass:1
Lord of heaven and earth:3
Accept:1
And over against the border of the priests the Levites shall have five and twenty thousand in length:1
I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah:1
and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up:1
and we will not forsake the house of our God:1
How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance:1
and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you:1
because the service of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their shoulders:1
fifty thousand:6
of which the LORD:5
they wandered through the wilderness:1
My LORD and my God:1
And sent messengers before his face:1
and running over:1
Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai:1
and so did Joshua:1
and indeed bear with me:1
prince of the children of Ephraim:1
upon whom the tower in Siloam fell:1
Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets:1
But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength:1
I was despised in her eyes:1
and the four corners thereof had undersetters:1
Then thine heart be lifted up:1
even we have believed in Jesus Christ:1
let us also walk in the Spirit:1
is God:82
because the soul of all the people was grieved:1
and if any say:1
which eat swine:1
The pots also:1
and lay thee hold on one of the young men:1
and sat her down over against him a good way off:1
Hoshea:3
so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham:1
Now these are the names of the tribes:1
and judge thy servants:2
and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh:1
is it not Samaria:1
and gave him a charge:1
and the measure of my days:1
that I may speak these words in their ears:1
and stripped off his armour:1
Let thy gifts be to thyself:1
And this word:1
The same day there came certain of the Pharisees:1
They shall run to and fro in the city:1
and before the sun:1
and the feast seven days:1
Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all four:1
and his brethren came to comfort him:1
And they did not receive him:1
And Abigail bare Amasa:1
that they may be taken:1
that his name may be famous in Israel:1
and hyssop:4
and he said:54
he put him in prison:1
nor meat offering:1
and this is the victory that overcometh the world:1
gather together:15
So speak ye:1
as in the days of her youth:1
in wrath remember mercy:1
and as a storm hurleth him out of his place:1
and be no more:4
when thou hast made an end of reading this book:1
and Casluhim:2
Who for a certain sedition made in the city:1
And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday:1
then shall the hand of the LORD be against you:1
and righteousness shall look down from heaven:1
which maketh himself a prophet to you:1
and begin at my sanctuary:1
because his hour was not yet come:1
and are driven of fierce winds:1
shall be God:1
and sprinkled both the book:1
with all the men of Israel:1
and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs:1
unto their horses:1
for whatsoever doth make manifest is light:1
that he sought an occasion against the Philistines:1
Then for Zechariah his son:1
which I have hallowed for my name:1
and their countries:1
and begat sons and daughters:16
and Ophrah:1
and the gods of Moab:1
and to the stranger:2
he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy:1
how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people:1
from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people:1
and incense:3
I will plead with thee:1
the family of the Palluites:1
He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly:1
Give us help from trouble:2
I will come on thee as a thief:1
and Midian:2
and the sons of Shemaiah:1
And Enos lived ninety years:1
and the lambs:1
Who found favour before God:1
The people therefore:2
And David heard of it:1
shall be a profane place for the city:1
when the priests were come out of the holy place:2
and shalt wave them for a wave offering before the LORD:1
and all the houses of Jerusalem:1
we shall be saved from wrath through him:1
stand thou here by me:1
and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth:1
He arose:1
and I have not made supplication unto the LORD:1
is not Samaria as Damascus:1
and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh:1
Of the sons of Naphtali after their families:1
and out of the half tribe of Manasseh:2
to the young man knowledge and discretion:1
Be ye come out:1
and long life:1
the judgment was set:1
And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily:1
And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant:1
and wring off his head from his neck:1
therefore shall he leave his blood upon him:1
Who hath heard such a thing:1
then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised:1
ruling in the fear of God:1
And the king commanded:5
and twenty he goats:1
even fourteen days:1
because he hath known my name:1
and Irad begat Mehujael:1
and Greek:4
in the day of temptation in the wilderness:2
No doubt but ye are the people:1
when thou dost embrace her:1
and the thief cometh in:1
into the holy chambers of the priests:1
whom God went to redeem to be his own people:1
and cover the ark of testimony with it:1
before the hills was I brought forth:1
And while he yet spake:4
ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven:1
he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm:1
and stand forth with your helmets:1
and put them on the great stone:1
To bind his princes at his pleasure:1
and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief:1
Of Hilkiah:1
The archers have sorely grieved him:1
and knowest not that thou art wretched:1
lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me:1
and the body is more than raiment:1
Turn you:3
and went all night:1
concerning the houses of this city:1
So do God to me:1
One of themselves:1
to shew it unto Esther:1
I have appointed thee each day for a year:1
wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me:1
or hath deceived his neighbour:1
Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem:1
For I verily:1
so also for himself:1
For the grave cannot praise thee:1
the Chaldeans:61
and weep with them that weep:1
also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision:1
and a law:2
For I through the law am dead to the law:1
but there standeth one among you:1
and to return:1
thou mayest not set a stranger over thee:1
but God delivered him not into his hand:1
Art thou Joab:1
when thou art come into the hand of thy friend:1
and let all the congregation stone him:1
and still he holdeth fast his integrity:1
and about his house:1
whose glorious beauty is a fading flower:1
And Nob:2
let them say continually:1
And as soon as the commandment came abroad:1
ye sons of the sorceress:1
thou hast been displeased:1
therefore I command thee to do this thing:2
Blessed be Egypt my people:1
And Gallio cared for none of those things:1
and there he put the man whom he had formed:1
and the young men laid hold on him:1
And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha:1
having their thumbs and their great toes cut off:1
for the cedar is fallen:1
And he shall set engines of war against thy walls:1
And Jesus came and touched them:1
until thou have destroyed them:1
which Joab shed:1
to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples:1
but also for conscience sake:1
By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted:1
and shall be with us for ever:1
and he girded up his loins:1
Wherefore say unto the house of Israel:1
and what shall be the sign of thy coming:1
this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance:1
And by the border of Issachar:1
If we had been in the days of our fathers:1
Gad:91
so shall thy servant do:1
and is safe:1
And they said unto him:21
if thou be surety for thy friend:1
Therefore will I also deal in fury:1
even you above all people:1
he saw me:2
come up to us quickly:1
that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:1
and Kirjathjearim:1
And he shook off the beast into the fire:1
thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid:1
And they put his armour in the house of their gods:1
of Hupham:1
and contention shall go out:1
and the floods came:2
partakers of the heavenly calling:1
And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations:1
Pithon:2
And Joseph placed his father and his brethren:1
and they feared the people:1
and shall put on other garments:1
ye said unto me:2
and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:1
all of them were expressed by name:1
I called not:2
will they not say that ye are mad:1
Wherefore say:4
for he careth for you:1
and Saul gathered all Israel together:1
even to make all ready:1
and thy judges of whom thou saidst:1
All this is come upon us:1
unto king Solomon in Jerusalem:1
when evil cometh upon us:1
If God be for us:1
every one in his own house:1
to put a sword in their hand to slay us:1
And his sons went and feasted in their houses:1
that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:1
all the beasts of the nations:1
Asaiah:6
without rebuke:1
and hath not performed my commandments:1
Then the Philistines said:1
Say not in thine heart:1
the children of Sisera:2
and please them:1
The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ:1
And I will raise up for them a plant of renown:1
and the candlestick:5
He hath made every thing beautiful in his time:1
That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season:1
And when thou art spoiled:1
break thy league with Baasha king of Israel:2
with a multitude that kept holyday:1
for to morrow we die:1
And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it:1
And he answering said unto them:1
But Jehoshabeath:1
that was over the household:1
and he is the saviour of the body:1
and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed:1
And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem:1
Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them:1
By his neesings a light doth shine:1
Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house:1
he loosed him from his bands:1
s servants said unto the king:1
who is made without fear:1
who was born to Bethuel:1
We see not our signs:1
because he is the Son of man:1
and Jahmai:1
and went into Galilee:1
God hath numbered thy kingdom:1
And now I ask one petition of thee:1
Father Abraham:1
but the birthright was Joseph:1
to repair the house of the LORD his God:1
Therefore thy gates shall be open continually:1
neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon:1
Or if he ask a fish:1
and put them upon Eleazar his son:2
came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet:3
For when for the time ye ought to be teachers:1
but when shall these things be:1
by the noise of his roaring:1
And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword:1
and with all the family of the house of his mother:1
And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle:1
that I sin not with my tongue:1
To him give all the prophets witness:1
his word runneth very swiftly:1
I had fainted:1
But this cometh to pass:1
or pearls:1
him ye will receive:1
cut it off:6
and before his host:1
and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you:1
and bring no fruit to perfection:1
And Jacob said unto his brethren:1
And had suffered many things of many physicians:1
and them that wept and wailed greatly:1
O LORD God of heaven:1
and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth:1
And the world passeth away:1
And as I began to speak:1
was come unto Absalom:1
because of the children of Israel:5
For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth:1
and the rest were blinded:1
as those that have been long dead:1
Now we beseech you:1
Let these sayings sink down into your ears:1
How is the strong staff broken:1
And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage:1
and he were cast into the sea:1
Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman:1
and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God:1
and the priest shall take his handful of it:1
Now when Jesus was in Bethany:1
as he met them:1
and burn them upon the altar for a burnt offering:1
For God is the King of all the earth:1
and grow as the vine:1
and sound wisdom:1
the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan:1
Without the vail of the testimony:1
which sing among the branches:1
And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master:1
and his treason that he wrought:1
and the Egyptians fled against it:1
and with them the elders of every city:1
Incline my heart unto thy testimonies:1
And Shebuel the son of Gershom:1
It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them:1
s latchet I am not worthy to unloose:1
thy blessing is upon thy people:1
Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you:1
All flesh is not the same flesh:1
I have two daughters which have not known man:1
but let us fight against them in the plain:1
Well:11
and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims:1
and he turned:2
and he healed him:1
And as some spake of the temple:1
and I have replenished every sorrowful soul:1
And some fell among thorns:3
Mark me:1
Also Jeshua:1
Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity:1
and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:1
And the LORD said unto Noah:1
thou shalt not die:4
Hear attentively the noise of his voice:1
and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD:1
He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth:1
and Israel to reproaches:1
when it was profaned:1
the tent:100
now will we deal worse with thee:1
and now is:2
Now ye Philippians know also:1
And when Moses:5
When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance:1
and the beloved city:1
And the land is defiled:1
and cursed them:1
and Jozabad:5
Then went Boaz up to the gate:1
and went to the valley of salt:1
they believed it not:1
and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land:1
he hath seen the Father:1
And Achish answered and said to David:1
and do to him what shall seem good unto thee:1
And at midnight there was a cry made:1
lest I come and smite the earth with a curse:1
and John his brother:4
and the simple will beware:1
and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way:1
and their land shall be soaked with blood:1
And the work of the bases was on this manner:1
and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood:1
Also they reported his good deeds before me:1
new Jerusalem:2
Every wise woman buildeth her house:1
and Tilon:1
and to bring into contempt all the honourable of the earth:1
get thee unto this treasurer:1
And all mine are thine:1
than:876
Caleb the son of Jephunneh:15
Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow:1
and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth choose:1
for they say:3
and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness:1
save of thee:2
And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai:1
And he looked this way and that way:1
Trouble me not:1
he saw a great multitude about them:1
Therefore are they before the throne of God:1
and dig for it more than for hid treasures:1
and the right shoulder:3
and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation:1
except they wash their hands oft:1
that they are wrought in God:1
When ye be come into the land of your habitations:1
And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom:1
thou driedst up mighty rivers:1
lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf:1
that thou saidst:1
my tongue hath spoken in my mouth:1
ye masters:1
of Jeduthun:8
According to all that the LORD commanded Moses:1
because it went evil with his house:1
Bless ye the LORD:2
which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother:1
and I sent him not:1
according to all that the LORD commanded Moses:5
And he enquired of the LORD for him:1
And all the people came near unto him:1
and to thy seed for ever:1
and given her a bill of divorce:1
a strength to the needy in his distress:1
even from thy dwelling place:2
and the prophets that prophesy unto you:1
and the flocks:5
for they said:11
saying in the speech of Lycaonia:1
that he may sift you as wheat:1
until he stand before the congregation in judgment:1
then are ye my disciples indeed:1
Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly:1
Peaceably:2
Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart:1
though it was turned to the contrary:1
at Bethshemesh:2
seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them:1
and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth:1
and burnt it at the brook Kidron:1
and sanctify them:2
but either to tell:1
that thou canst not know them:1
and the hills melt:1
for the people spake of stoning him:1
the angel of the Lord came upon them:1
Take now thy son:1
a just man:8
and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:1
all that might do service in the tabernacle of the congregation:2
And when they go forth into the utter court:1
or if he ask a fish:1
whereby we cry:1
and righteousness remain in the fruitful field:1
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts:1
Give us seven days:1
she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof:1
even Jesus:4
neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy:1
which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom:1
And the Levites shall speak:1
and lift up her voice:1
whose foundation was overflown with a flood:1
a land of corn and wine:2
and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven:1
shall wither:6
neither shall the sword go through your land:1
And let them gather all the food of those good years that come:1
they are not known in the streets:1
and dry ground into watersprings:1
take thee a barber:1
thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name:1
that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together:1
and the elder shall serve the younger:1
that with all boldness they may speak thy word:1
And Jesus answering saith unto them:2
And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD:1
And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father:1
And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman:1
but the election hath obtained it:1
and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen:1
and my fellow-prisoners:1
I will shake mine hand upon them:1
he hath done evil to this people:1
that shall rule my people Israel:1
that was cast into the sea:1
All these were reckoned by genealogies in the days of Jotham king of Judah:1
for his name was spread abroad:1
each man his dream in one night:1
neither knoweth any man the Father:1
as ye have heard with your ears:1
I have declared the former things from the beginning:1
I will go and return to my place:1
equally distant one from another:1
And her daughter was made whole from that very hour:1
I will return unto my house whence I came out:1
that they should kill David:1
He maketh them also to skip like a calf:1
and told Paul:1
they shall bear their sin:1
reprobate concerning the faith:1
that ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt:1
And for the other side of the court gate:1
and the carved images:2
and prophesied:4
And the woman was made whole from that hour:1
And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle:1
So they:52
and Seraiah:6
The families of the sons of Kohath shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle southward:1
and the trumpeters sounded:1
And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD:1
wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus:1
when he lieth down:1
and laid him on the altar upon the wood:1
and say:139
by reason of breakings they purify themselves:1
there is no cluster to eat:1
for the time of figs was not yet:1
for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light:1
So God created man in his own image:1
And the Jews marvelled:1
Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot:1
neither understand:4
and he covered them on the inside with wood:1
And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon:1
and unto us by the will of God:1
And when he had sent them away:1
for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil:1
doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it:1
There was no harlot in this place:1
and out of Syriamaachah:1
whether it be of men or beasts:1
but they let go the man and all his family:1
we do not war after the flesh:1
I am the LORD which sanctify you:1
and who is Apollos:1
And he called it Shebah:1
but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth:1
a great people and a strong:1
The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God:1
and let us enter into the defenced cities:1
all that are meet for the war:1
The LORD hath been sore displeased with your fathers:1
upon thy belly shalt thou go:1
The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council:1
Let us go and serve other gods:2
and the coney:1
and the thorns sprung up:1
that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to the families thereof:1
and given them to me:1
Who also hath gone about to profane the temple:1
and used enchantments:1
and take our daughters unto you:1
praise him with stringed instruments and organs:1
and an alien unto my mother:1
and thy tongue frameth deceit:1
dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone:1
swelling out in a high wall:1
teaching things which they ought not:1
and will judge thee according to thy ways:1
for all is vanity:2
by the washing of regeneration:1
and at such a time:4
And Jesus answered and said unto her:1
and it shall be done:2
that the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high:1
And said unto the king:2
that the offence might abound:1
and they beat him also:1
according unto the saying of the LORD:1
All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned:1
for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits:1
and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip:1
until these calamities be overpast:1
neither shalt thou gather every grape of thy vineyard:1
it speaketh deceit:1
and the separate place:1
with a very grievous blow:1
and from the house of Millo:1
And his chains fell off from his hands:1
And all the devils besought him:1
and sorrow and mourning shall flee away:1
And Moses let his father in law depart:1
fire and brimstone:5
and into the cabins:1
that did he in heaven:1
ye endured a great fight of afflictions:1
But when he was yet a great way off:1
and on which it was borne up:1
even unto me Daniel:1
and lie in wait for him:1
both which are in heaven:1
which David the king had made to praise the LORD:1
Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD:1
receive him as myself:1
And he shall take of it his handful:1
And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not:1
and the prophecy of Oded the prophet:1
s mother laid:1
while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee:1
and I am the least in my father:1
For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek:1
Hear now my reasoning:1
come down from the cross:3
and Suchathites:1
and believe the gospel:1
that my footsteps slip not:1
who are his witnesses unto the people:1
and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah:1
come down ere my child die:1
Because thou hast forgotten me:1
and smote three thousand of them:1
In the six hundredth year of Noah:1
I had in mine heart to build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD:1
and they shall bring thy sons in their arms:1
He delivereth me from mine enemies:1
So Rabshakeh returned:1
and godly:3
but with God all things are possible:1
Remove from me the way of lying:1
And Jethro said:2
Forsake her not:1
for seed of the field:1
when he went in unto his brother:1
which was the son of Neri:1
eternal in the heavens:1
Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this land:1
when we are absent one from another:1
when ye defile it:1
The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations:1
as the lion:2
And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds:1
s son of the tribe of Naphtali:1
even the second bullock of seven years old:1
and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter:1
Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead:1
But I will come to you shortly:1
Turn in:1
until I make thine enemies thy footstool:2
and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:1
that the Midianites came up:1
that ye may see:1
peradventure the LORD will come to meet me:1
and build the house:4
duke Timnah:2
and there was a great cry in Egypt:1
to bear his cross:2
And thou mourn at the last:1
and all Israel went thither a whoring after it:1
and Canaan shall be his servant:2
and there came out this calf:1
Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods:1
it is a tree of life:1
For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence:1
nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel:1
and Sabtechah:1
a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren:1
he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries:1
and honour him:1
And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the LORD:1
And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee:1
Remember Lot:1
which was anointed with the holy oil:1
God himself is with us for our captain:1
An ungodly witness scorneth judgment:1
And Elishama:3
all Israel shouted with a great shout:1
that it might be by grace:1
whom he hath chosen:3
the shittah tree:1
so that they shall come again into this land:1
and came and besieged Rabbah:1
And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand:1
as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot:1
surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall:1
And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth:1
and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage:1
And there arose certain:1
s daughter looked through a window:1
and twenty measures of pure oil:1
give ear unto my speech:1
s custom with the people was:1
every man according to his ability:1
or of the sabbath days:1
And when they had made an end of offering:1
and worship thou him:1
s house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon:1
Through wisdom is an house builded:1
the Lord of hosts:1
Then answered Simon:1
Thou shalt abide for me many days:1
and every winged fowl after his kind:1
for manslayers:1
and the remnant in Judah perish:1
and put fire therein:2
It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop:1
she profaneth her father:1
And as for me:3
and that mine adversary had written a book:1
for thy judgments are good:1
The sons of Rachel:2
But as for the mighty man:1
that Benhadad numbered the Syrians:1
that he commanded his sons not to drink wine:1
From twenty years old and upward:1
but after they had looked a great while:1
which were meet to be given her:1
and whole:3
And they told him:4
And he came down with them:1
And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the LORD:1
Thou art our sister:1
in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double:1
having wards one against another:1
for then was it better with me than now:1
and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:1
And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull:1
neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin:1
then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried:1
The ark:5
for I said:2
These are the sons of Seir the Horite:1
and they shall come near to my table:1
and declareth unto man what is his thought:1
If when he seeth the sword come upon the land:1
Thou also shalt be drunken:1
nor covetous man:1
so he blessed him:1
neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome:1
Grace be unto you:5
as the king bade:1
even against it:1
and from avenging myself with mine own hand:1
heresies:3
that the plowman shall overtake the reaper:1
or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul:1
and by flame:1
and another fourth part they confessed:1
do bring a flood of waters upon the earth:1
Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land:1
and dwell there:10
when they came into the midst of the city:1
to be unto you for servants and for handmaids:1
And if a man shall take his brother:1
drunkenness:7
that they may eat within thy gates:1
in the hill of Hachilah:3
he removed him into this land:1
That frustrateth the tokens of the liars:1
on the day thou goest out:2
And they had in their inheritance Beersheba:1
Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung:1
Is not my help in me:1
crowned with glory and honour:1
some an hundredfold:2
and they had on their heads crowns of gold:1
let that night be solitary:1
and over the Ashurites:1
And Moses went out to meet his father in law:1
All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD:1
thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin:1
as though they were not her:1
Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD:1
And the ass said unto Balaam:1
afflictions:13
And Abraham begat Isaac:1
to whom it shall be imputed:1
There is a lad here:1
The words of his mouth were smoother than butter:1
whom the children of Israel consumed not:1
For he was a good man:1
and the kingdom from Damascus:1
cherubims and palm trees:6
Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph:1
when she had received the spies with peace:1
she and her inhabitants:1
And he bought fine linen:1
and they stood upon their feet:1
and hating one another:1
as Esau:1
from Benjamin:1
and told Pharaoh:2
this is the man that made not God his strength:1
Then I was by him:1
and shall leave them there:1
The LORD looketh from heaven:1
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second time:1
whose name was Atarah:1
the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm:1
and the sorcerers:2
Set a watch:1
and was not able to finish:1
to the house of Bethuel thy mother:1
And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire:1
she was leprous:1
the noise of them that rejoice endeth:1
nor his army:1
that sacrificeth in gardens:1
and which may bring them in:1
and his armourbearer slew after him:1
to make Israel to sin:1
and abide with the king:1
all of them with shield and helmet:1
And he overtook them:1
here is my daughter a maiden:1
and his arm shall rule for him:1
and thou shalt not dwell therein:1
which is shed for many:2
And the second took her to wife:1
nor understand with their heart:1
but because of the people which stand by I said it:1
But if he thus say:1
for he had told them that he was a Jew:1
when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle:1
mine:756
But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel:1
AND LORD OF LORDS:1
With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance:1
Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble:2
He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life:1
and of the springs:1
These are the statutes and judgments and laws:1
And thou shalt do according to the sentence:1
And David said:61
and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed:1
While the child was yet alive:1
that ye come not together unto condemnation:1
My root was spread out by the waters:1
seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him:1
And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim:1
the son of Bichri:8
for he hath greatly withstood our words:1
while I was yet with you:1
And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the congregation:1
we wait for light:1
And Gilead:2
And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah:1
and poured out there their drink offerings:1
and I will draw out a sword after them:2
Grace be with you all:2
And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years:1
The LORD preserveth the strangers:1
He is a leprous man:1
And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground:1
therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place:1
to destroy him:4
eat the fat:4
because he saith:1
sing together:1
and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon:1
and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief:1
These six cities shall be a refuge:1
so shalt thou put evil away from among you:2
and things wherein there is no profit:1
the daughter riseth up against her mother:1
wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand:1
And he cast for it four rings of gold:2
put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness:1
and five cubits on that side:1
and Shoham:1
Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath:1
for there was joy in Israel:1
he went and told the chief captain:1
O my love:2
For whosoever will save his life shall lose it:3
to teach in the cities of Judah:1
Mordecai:60
Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not:1
Praise ye the LORD from the heavens:1
for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers:1
and make my speech nothing worth:1
the vine shall give her fruit:1
And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days:1
that there is no fear of God before his eyes:1
for my name is in him:1
and I will sing praises unto thy name:1
And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake:1
that I said:7
Hanoch:6
the herb yielding seed:1
I will bless her:2
their lord was fallen down dead on the earth:1
This charge I commit unto thee:1
unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living:1
And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan:1
even of the Canaanites:1
And he went unto his father:1
Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant:1
ye kill them that are fed:1
and how he warred:1
and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee:1
and asked him the truth of all this:1
Appoint a way:1
that they should be the LORD:1
and thy thoughts which are to us-ward:1
And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the children of Israel:1
have I gathered all the earth:1
I will punish the king of Babylon and his land:1
and the water came out abundantly:1
and they spake against me:1
unto the priests that minister in the house of our God:1
for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed:1
as thou swarest unto our fathers:1
in the spirit:21
I will fetch my knowledge from afar:1
and do unto them:1
For the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the ark:1
but that which we had from the beginning:1
neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices:1
Likewise at the same time said I unto the people:1
and it displease him:1
Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah:1
sick:134
nor eat moist grapes:1
for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan:1
and his eyes were enlightened:1
which is not written in the book of this law:1
And the priest shall bring them before the LORD:1
that saith unto Zion:1
The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan:1
not the angels of heaven:1
and a gift destroyeth the heart:1
Thus saith the LORD unto this people:1
For the sins of her prophets:1
which I have builded:1
and Pilate gave him leave:1
For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world:1
these were the sons of Bashemath Esau:1
here is water:1
Bezai:3
but thou wast cast out in the open field:1
unless ye have believed in vain:1
therefore she is removed:1
or profane person:1
for if ye do these things:1
shalt thou not uncover:2
that his heart died within him:1
And Peter said:3
in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah:1
and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy:1
and let us rise up against her in battle:1
that they might find an accusation against him:1
and the king of Eglon:1
and dwelt there unto this day:1
these are the sons of Bashemath Esau:1
that are in the land of Canaan:1
AND TO SING PRAISES UNTO THY NAME:1
Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance:1
For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me:1
Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead:1
and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem:1
as it were a bow shot:1
To have respect of persons is not good:1
neither is there breath left in me:1
dimness of anguish:1
and to keep himself unspotted from the world:1
and are cast into a land which they know not:1
and closed up the flesh instead thereof:1
But Thomas:1
and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:1
ye husbands:1
Rabbi:9
yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written:1
And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white:1
revive thy work in the midst of the years:1
and he shall destroy wonderfully:1
if he were a prophet:1
that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour:1
The hangings of the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits:1
the desire of the wicked shall perish:1
But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal:1
and not before the saints:1
and opened her mouth without measure:1
goodness:51
And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate:1
and in Edom:1
Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron:2
seeing that thou doest these things:1
and they have not known my ways:2
or look we for another:2
and served groves and idols:1
which I have given to the fire for fuel:1
And his breath:1
They shall eat the meat offering:1
Ahaziah his son:2
and they were greatly distressed:1
and I will make of thee a multitude of people:1
if thou be silent to me:1
when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted:1
I have not found it by secret search:1
And when they had stripped him:1
and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah:1
and Imna:1
seeing thou couldest reveal this secret:1
And Abraham rose up early in the morning:2
as captives taken with the sword:1
Therefore came I forth to meet thee:1
Of Gershom:1
thou shalt weep no more:1
The children of Hariph:1
and they shall spoil the pomp of Egypt:1
These things said Esaias:1
Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel:1
they shall cease:2
which are entered into thine house:1
and in all these things is the life of my spirit:1
and who may say unto him:1
This is one thing:1
I bring near my righteousness:1
it shall not cleave to me:1
And I will bring you out from the people:1
to shed blood:8
ye do wrong:1
and they took Paul:1
whiles I was speaking in prayer:1
and shall not be quenched:2
And upon all the cedars of Lebanon:1
Cush:18
and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:1
carry them to the city:1
And Levi made him a great feast in his own house:1
and their multitude:2
And they said among themselves:1
He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him:1
and Saul said unto Jonathan his son:1
and told David how the men were served:1
till three whole weeks were fulfilled:1
But he is in one mind:1
Weep not:3
the widow woman was there gathering of sticks:1
that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness:1
At the last it biteth like a serpent:1
when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom:1
If I should say:1
take heed to thyself:3
And when the Philistine looked about:1
And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of:1
and I will plant you:1
If ye then:5
that grace may abound:1
and not pluck them up:1
he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen:1
and cover it with dust:1
that it was imputed to him:1
that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together:1
and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed:1
And Elkanah her husband said unto her:1
and the ashes poured out from the altar:1
s wife bare him sons:1
Wherefore shall he be slain:1
and to whomsoever I will I give it:1
that did the work:5
and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins:1
and went after his wife:1
and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam:1
which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them:1
Hear counsel:1
So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day:1
I will hear the heavens:1
and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets:1
And Moses said unto Pharaoh:1
nor walked in my law:1
and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me:1
Every man according as he purposeth in his heart:1
Meshullam:24
they shall not delight in it:1
they fell on their faces:1
neither will he help the evil doers:1
therefore is wrath upon thee from before the LORD:1
And he lay with her that night:1
For if Abraham were justified by works:1
All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem:1
Bethel with the towns thereof:1
and a ram out of the flock:2
For they have made ready their heart like an oven:1
Of every tribe a thousand:1
s silver:7
and present them before the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:1
Because he hath set his love upon me:1
but to the evil:1
and his own counsel shall cast him down:1
even by our father Isaac:1
in serving thee six years:1
and that doeth the like to any one of these things:1
And David was then in an hold:1
to what end is it for you:1
Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon:1
yet surely I will make thee a wilderness:1
If any man have ears to hear:2
came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation:1
according to the oaths of the tribes:1
and be very sorrowful:1
that it may yield unto you the increase thereof:1
and Jarah begat Alemeth:1
princesses:1
and did obeisance unto the king:1
For enquire:1
and all the people of the land rejoiced:1
that he should put his hands on them:1
He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword:1
shall it not be said unto you:1
And so did they with the oxen:1
and the house of their fathers increased greatly:1
then I loved him:1
and manifested forth his glory:1
Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh:1
And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days:1
Mithredath:2
the son of Raguel the Midianite:1
what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth:1
I have strength:1
Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness:1
And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart:1
and they knew not any thing:1
God shall send forth his mercy and his truth:1
and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city:1
Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees:1
the hind also calved in the field:1
And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail:1
and landed at Tyre:1
He asked water:1
and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another:1
The man answered and said unto them:1
for before his translation he had this testimony:1
and Jesus was left alone:1
on the north three gates:1
and Tema:3
But Absalom fled:2
Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth:1
All the congregation of Israel shall keep it:1
and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering:1
and the third part of the waters became wormwood:1
He will not suffer me to take my breath:1
even against David:1
who should be the greatest:1
Which doeth great things past finding out:1
and scatter them over the city:1
even the prophecy:1
but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever:1
Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey:1
from heaven:96
lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow:1
and shall go out by the way of the same:1
and the plowing of the wicked:1
for thou hast done right:1
And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold:2
I know that the LORD hath given you the land:1
And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about:1
Would ye tarry for them till they were grown:1
thou art called a Jew:1
so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth:1
ye drunkards:1
and in the morning bread to the full:1
and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster:1
and thine oxen:1
behold them:3
the son of Abraham:2
and all his bowels gushed out:1
whose damnation is just:1
and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit:1
The thing is true:1
from the fat of the mighty:1
all the days of our life:2
and yet I say unto you:1
wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day:1
Give ear to my words:1
and God made a wind to pass over the earth:1
For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell:1
with the officers:3
by the which he condemned the world:1
And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him:1
who destroyed this house:1
Nevertheless Haman refrained himself:1
When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbour:1
an he goat also:1
according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes:1
Give me thy vineyard for money:1
if my kingdom were of this world:1
his wonders:7
and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter:1
and I spake unto you:1
and much people of the city was with her:1
unto the mount of Olives:2
and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim:1
A sower went out to sow his seed:1
The lips of the wise disperse knowledge:1
and not of commandment:1
and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah:1
leave me not to mine oppressors:1
to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer:1
so for men to search their own glory is not glory:1
thy words were heard:1
and covered the chariots:1
And the watchman saw another man running:1
And she hasted:1
And they shall wander from sea to sea:1
Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise:1
Doth not their excellency which is in them go away:1
that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen:1
and their camels were without number:2
Whatsoever is sold in the shambles:1
spices for anointing oil:2
and the overlaying of their chapiters of silver:1
and all his glory:1
Hear this word:2
murders:4
for they are deceitful meat:1
and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily:1
and there was no strength in him:1
that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou:1
For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor:1
s children shall bow down before thee:1
to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people:1
the hand of the Lord is upon thee:1
and put breath in you:1
and the iniquity of our fathers:1
They saw it:1
save thy people:1
hath he not called:2
are built up a spiritual house:1
And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest:1
and believed not for his wondrous works:1
And Jesse took an ass laden with bread:1
For thus hath the LORD said:3
and fled from them naked:1
and done according as he hath said:1
so is good news from a far country:1
to go to enter into Egypt:1
stand up:38
but the answer of a good conscience toward God:1
neither staves:1
Are these things so:1
Then was the iron:1
and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof:1
and be raised again the third day:1
All these cities were fenced with high walls:1
and burnt incense:4
at Mizpah:2
and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life:1
They were children of fools:1
And they brought unto him a penny:1
and thy years shall not fail:1
And the elders of the town trembled at his coming:1
Hereby know we the spirit of truth:1
A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump:1
Jesus said unto them:21
Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords:1
but they went both of them away quickly:1
And they covet fields:1
when her waves do roar like great waters:1
He made a way to his anger:1
and watch:5
I am doing a great work:1
Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord:1
The grass withereth:3
his cords:1
and another hated:1
and like your brethren:1
And Bashemath Ishmael:1
and comfort your hearts:1
the eyes of all Israel are upon thee:1
Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee:1
and that it may go well with thee:1
and upon every herb of the field:1
And the officers shall speak further unto the people:1
and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem:1
Zechariah the son of Jonathan:1
then keep thee from every wicked thing:1
happy is that people:1
Woe is me for my hurt:1
But Jonathan Saul:1
and the spoil of beasts:1
when he goeth abroad:1
Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him:1
Nevertheless I must walk to day:1
also the princes and all the people will be wholly at thy commandment:1
and fifty loops in the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second:1
because there fell wrath for it against Israel:1
For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise:1
and thy right hand shall hold me:1
and burn incense upon the hills:1
Do not rich men oppress you:1
for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh:1
And the angel said unto her:1
though I have committed nothing against the people:1
The LORD is my rock:2
which the king:7
which cry day and night unto him:1
mocking:6
Now this I say:2
But the voice answered me again from heaven:1
The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants:1
The living:1
Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah:1
So they made an end of dividing the country:1
And David came to Saul:1
Thou shalt call:2
but a prudent man covereth shame:1
And Joseph was a goodly person:1
for ye are not my people:1
after they had carried it about:1
all males from a month old and upward:1
ye shall take it patiently:1
then they should have turned them from their evil way:1
as though we reached not unto you:1
shall he not hear:1
Then Moses trembled:1
Again the high priest asked him:1
that killeth an ox:2
In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired:1
then he forsook God which made him:1
and smote him there under the fifth rib:1
him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you:1
whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:1
as he hath said unto you:1
and for the wall of the city:1
therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem:1
shall they take away:2
Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey:1
and come down from the cross:1
but my servant:1
and in the law:1
seeing I know not a man:1
he hath left off to be wise:1
and his countenance fell:1
The children of Zattu:2
But call to remembrance the former days:1
For if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings:1
Nahbi the son of Vophsi:1
who hath enabled me:1
this hath been by your means:1
in the day that thou wast born:1
If any be blameless:1
for they be persuaded that John was a prophet:1
whom he raised up in their stead:1
neither hearken unto thy voice:1
drink thou also:1
than to dwell in the tents of wickedness:1
Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah:1
s day:370
whom they would:1
and the beasts of the earth:1
and it shall remove:1
and there he proved them:1
and after his sons:1
shall straiten them:1
and my soul:6
Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers:1
and Lot journeyed east:1
And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat:1
And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest:1
whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world:1
and take you away from the earth:1
was the principal to begin the thanksgiving in prayer:1
were eight thousand and five hundred and fourscore:1
Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist:1
and they brought the LORD:1
And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar:1
thy reward shall return upon thine own head:1
are we the better:1
or by the hearing of faith:2
haste thee to help me:1
For he taught them as one having authority:1
The LORD watch between me and thee:1
He that is unjust:1
unto their assembly:1
and none of them is lost:1
And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash his clothes:1
heal thyself:1
and preached every where:1
and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth:1
And I appoint unto you a kingdom:1
the heavenly Jerusalem:1
Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles:1
we were kept under the law:1
his mother said:5
And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre:1
and ten thousand men after him:1
and among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all Israel:1
And they could not answer him again to these things:1
when David was come to Mahanaim:1
of the wicked:104
He giveth snow like wool:1
then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it:2
And Peter answered him and said:1
And in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast:1
and the length of thy days:1
The LORD your God which goeth before you:1
But if thine heart turn away:1
all vessels of small quantity:1
And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers:1
neither be ye sorry:1
having breastplates of fire:1
So Jeroboam and all Israel came and spake to Rehoboam:1
and that which was found in him:1
Better is little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and trouble therewith:1
Believest thou this:1
and hast consumed us:1
and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon:1
that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD:1
They have Moses and the prophets:1
And I will cast you out of my sight:1
Talitha cumi:1
and let all the people say:1
Solomon clave unto these in love:1
Egypt:721
nor by dreams:1
But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them:1
For even hereunto were ye called:1
and art become my salvation:1
and joy in my people:1
Ahinoam the Jezreelitess:5
They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house:1
and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already:1
astonishment hath taken hold on me:1
Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren:1
because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen:1
He delivereth the poor in his affliction:1
as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land:1
and she shall say:1
and not with meat:1
and their carcases were torn in the midst of the streets:1
they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:1
And they set themselves in array against the city:1
And the sons of Uzziel:1
or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering:1
he will not turn from it:1
and brake their bands in sunder:1
and the barley:2
and toward all the land of the plain:1
And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace:1
for which the LORD their God had sent him to them:1
and bring us not over Jordan:1
And Rabbith:1
I will even set my face against that soul:2
and to Eloth:1
Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine:1
walked we not in the same spirit:1
and to his servants:1
she went her way:1
or caterpillers:1
but saith unto him:1
and Sarah shall have a son:2
Also I spake to the priests and to all this people:1
but God had mercy on him:1
and will glorify it again:1
I come after you:1
Howbeit he meaneth not so:1
and be taken:1
at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth:1
and burned them with fire:1
shall gather themselves unto thee:1
from heaven shall it come down upon thee:1
and we have borne their iniquities:1
he will forsake you:1
And Boaz begat Obed:1
Slay her not in the house of the LORD:1
Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country:1
your burnt offerings are not acceptable:1
that her warfare is accomplished:1
Stand up:3
even a blessing in the midst of the land:1
every one that thirsteth:1
and marred their vine branches:1
But Jesus answered them:1
and to cover his face:1
it is a fretting leprosy in the house:1
God blessed for ever:1
The waters saw thee:1
Whither is thy beloved gone:1
keepers of the gates of the tabernacle:1
and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire:1
beholding these things:1
They shall be holy unto their God:1
s taskmasters had set over them:1
and which have not known the depths of Satan:1
they shall put bands upon thee:1
insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him:1
They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness:1
have they uttered their voice:1
but ye feed not the flock:1
and there was a javelin in Saul:1
and with them he taught the men of Succoth:1
and Hul:2
shall be unclean until the even:11
And they launched forth:1
which of them will love him most:1
s servant that is bought for money:1
And thou shalt say unto him:1
but I give myself unto prayer:1
Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness:1
And Hukok with her suburbs:1
and fourscore concubines:1
unto the residue of his people:1
For they shall hear of thy great name:1
ye shall ask what ye will:1
deceitful workers:1
but they went not:1
and be changed unto white:1
Observe and hear all these words which I command thee:1
And the thing was known to Mordecai:1
Now the brother shall betray the brother to death:1
it shall teach:2
were forty and five thousand six hundred and fifty:1
and floods upon the dry ground:1
make thy loins strong:1
The Hebrew servant:1
he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof:1
and beans:2
after thou hast lost the other:1
Fear thou not:3
and not strangers:1
So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul:1
According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly:1
this was the offering of Nahshon the son of Amminadab:1
but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame:1
and Rezeph:1
and lay no famine upon you:1
There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun:1
and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon:1
he sware by himself:1
Draw thy sword:3
Whilst it is yet in his greenness:1
pulling them out of the fire:1
And he asked Pharaoh:1
thy servant hath sheepshearers:1
Sallu:3
neither yet believe him:1
nor follow them:1
And again he sent unto them another servant:1
as the appearance of brightness:1
And ye shall keep my statutes:1
and her countenance was no more sad:1
for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people:1
and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein:1
I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans:1
and it shall be forgiven him:9
And woe unto them that are with child:1
as unto the Lord:1
And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD:1
to slay him with guile:1
therefore they fear not God:1
the Son of the living God:2
And the patriarchs:1
be not afraid of them:2
maketh the Son:1
slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks:1
and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take:1
to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power:1
Now therefore get you up:1
for to do them:1
s hands shall be rendered unto him:1
Beasts:1
And immediately:20
after that Lot was separated from him:1
because I am black:1
And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth:1
Therefore pray not thou for this people:2
That the slayer that killeth any person unawares and unwittingly may flee thither:1
when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall:1
and pulled her in unto him into the ark:1
or fallen down dead suddenly:1
and shall hiss him out of his place:1
and for my children:1
and the name of the other Peninnah:1
for this is well pleasing unto the Lord:1
Ebed the son of Jonathan:1
but a scorner heareth not rebuke:1
with spikenard:1
and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword:1
Let my father arise:1
And after they had tarried there a space:1
Wherefore putting away lying:1
Now there were seven brethren:1
as the Anakims:3
and a great crashing from the hills:1
Now Rachel had taken the images:1
which is called the synagogue of the Libertines:1
How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom:1
For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body:1
and willows of the brook:1
I declare things that are right:1
and his strength faileth:1
O Jacob and Israel:2
Elioenai the seventh:1
So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever:1
And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west:1
and I will give charge concerning thee:1
which cleaveth on us:1
his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen:1
Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number:1
that they may be made perfect in one:1
he was leprous in his forehead:1
and for four which it cannot bear:1
and judge me by thy strength:1
my spouse:6
Go not up after them:1
and let the wicked be no more:1
I will offer bullocks with goats:1
Therefore will I number you to the sword:1
Let God arise:1
he shall not die for the iniquity of his father:1
And when he was come into his house:1
Eleph:1
And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die:1
in whose sight I brought them out:1
to bring about all Israel unto thee:1
Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this:1
neither the pillar of fire by night:1
and the table of gold:1
Now therefore be content:1
They chose new gods:1
But I beseech you the rather to do this:1
O fear the LORD:1
and a good piece of flesh:2
when Pharaoh would hardly let us go:1
And the priest shall bring it unto the altar:1
Therefore now:10
Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD:1
and their sycomore trees with frost:1
Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him:1
be accepted before thee:2
being caused to fly swiftly:1
speak not with a stiff neck:1
and upon the men of Shechem:1
and departed not from it:1
and went up from Gilgal all night:1
Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door:1
according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight:1
and Eshtemoh:1
s friend by hearty counsel:1
And some of them believed:1
and all we had died this day:1
the son of Solomon:6
Whereunto he called you by our gospel:1
who smote Midian in the field of Moab:1
which were warriors:2
and they knew him:2
they shall spend their days in prosperity:1
and would have set them at one again:1
and continue there a year:1
And as soon as he had spoken:1
which thou gavest unto their fathers:3
therefore the misery of man is great upon him:1
And he made the vail of blue:1
he shall scatter among them the prey:1
And had taken the women captives:1
unto the LORD:483
let every man have his own wife:1
nor a stone for foundations:1
My God will cast them away:1
to walk in his statutes:1
though they speak fair words unto thee:1
but it is a witness between us and you:1
Then said they all:1
which is over against Galilee:1
being a disciple of Jesus:1
it is a meat offering:2
and set it in order for me:1
For we wrestle not against flesh and blood:1
Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection:1
Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD:1
And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said:1
the keeper of the women:1
hitherto thou wouldest not hear:1
And Balak:14
Deliver me my wife Michal:1
prince of the children of Zebulun:1
and the honourable man:2
Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God:1
Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies:1
and ye shall be blameless:1
thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth:1
and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth:1
nor jesting:1
that he may make peace with me:1
go down:75
See then that ye walk circumspectly:1
and thou shalt not borrow:1
of the new moons:2
and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten:1
and Sansannah:1
The earth is utterly broken down:1
I say the truth in Christ:1
shall be an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down:1
of the engraver:1
thou shalt smite them:1
The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus:1
His glory is great in thy salvation:1
they hunt every man his brother with a net:1
and the lizard:1
and in fine linen:2
blood:452
lest I mar mine own inheritance:1
the children of Siaha:1
I stand by the well of water:1
Thirty basons of gold:1
and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made:1
By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not:1
for God resisteth the proud:1
The precious sons of Zion:1
and he that uttereth a slander:1
and that they might have no favour:1
children of Belial:5
And she conceived again:5
and shall ye sit here:1
And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger:1
Of the children of Gad:1
of my hand didst thou require it:1
and friends:1
He made known his ways unto Moses:1
and with him an hundred and ten males:1
Come up hither:3
for he is poor:1
and they called his name Obed:1
is sin:42
Praise him with the timbrel and dance:1
the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the world:1
and bridleth not his tongue:1
he took hold of her:1
and set my feet upon a rock:1
and delivered our houses:1
Your iniquities:2
Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you:1
and lo a black horse:1
And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins:1
And he took a yoke of oxen:1
and his army shall overflow:1
only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus:1
Because:195
and saved him out of all his troubles:1
even to day do I declare that I will render double unto thee:1
O God of my salvation:1
shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham:1
And Nathan said to David:1
and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another:1
how high they are:1
and cut me off:1
What hath the LORD spoken:3
Hell and destruction are never full:1
Launch out into the deep:1
I cannot go with these:1
and in Egypt:1
went down:72
from him cometh my salvation:1
even an offering made by fire unto the LORD:2
and that the world may know that thou hast sent me:1
or God:69
and his testimonies:4
And one sea:1
and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers:1
how shall I make thee as Admah:1
They shall not make baldness upon their head:1
And all the kings of Arabia:2
he departed from Galilee:1
that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit:1
when I heard these words:1
whose waters cast up mire and dirt:1
For destruction from God was a terror to me:1
when he made mention of the ark of God:1
they strengthen also the hands of evildoers:1
Answerest thou the high priest so:1
And I went out by night by the gate of the valley:1
and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate:1
which went not astray when the children of Israel went astray:1
shout:65
and the covering of the badgers:1
they commit adultery:2
and take it away:1
To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn:1
and upon all his household:1
The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness:2
and the seats of them that sold doves:2
for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth:1
yet return again to me:1
And of the blue:1
and they entered into the land to destroy it:1
to increase the trespass of Israel:1
and the fig tree languisheth:1
Tiria:1
Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers:1
let them return unto thee:1
There is difference also between a wife and a virgin:1
and so we were in their sight:1
with a bowl upon the top of it:1
and devour it:1
and defraud:2
made he a woman:1
to save his life:3
and made the children of Israel drink of it:1
who compass me about:1
Then rose up certain of the elders of the land:1
he went down unto Caesarea:1
or of pearls:1
with flowers of lilies:2
it displeased him:2
for ye were afraid by reason of the fire:1
will I be the God of all the families of Israel:1
But forasmuch as he had not to pay:1
And I say also unto thee:1
If they shall confess their iniquity:1
I have cut off like a weaver my life:1
This is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him:1
Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect:1
and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother:1
And they truly were many priests:1
Tell it not in Gath:1
and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD:1
then he shall bear his iniquity:2
fight with Amalek:1
Happy shall he be:1
There was a certain creditor which had two debtors:1
She said:2
The memory of the just is blessed:1
Then David arose from the earth:1
and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies:1
And the whole valley of the dead bodies:1
between us and you there is a great gulf fixed:1
which are called Havothjair unto this day:1
which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer:1
and Abishai his brother slew Abner:1
and mine hand take hold on judgment:1
with their backs toward the temple of the LORD:1
Wherefore are we counted as beasts:1
And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam:1
and the prophets thereof divine for money:1
He hath not dealt with us after our sins:1
and none delivereth:1
Go up to Ramothgilead:2
and we will be with thee in the war:1
for the press is full:1
Go into the city to such a man:1
On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel:1
and speak good words to them:2
But the woman fearing and trembling:1
and escaped that night:1
s heart shall melt:1
because thou closest thyself in cedar:1
By Silvanus:1
for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels:2
and unto the plain of the vineyards:1
and that I may drive them out of the land:1
among the multitude:3
because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD:1
Then answered Bildad the Shuhite:3
Also we certify you:1
and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians:1
some more:1
and that they might see that they themselves are beasts:1
And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you:1
I have given thee cow:1
that they would consider their latter end:1
and write upon it:2
and he:1436
a city in the uttermost of thy border:1
And there ye shall serve gods:1
and Jidlaph:1
And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone:1
It was planted in a good soil by great waters:1
but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind:1
and his tabernacle:1
that they turned from their evil way:1
which brought them out of the land of Egypt:1
the voice of speech:1
because these waters shall come thither:1
Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:1
He that hath two coats:1
a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury:1
And he received them at their hand:1
that as ye were a curse among the heathen:1
And Jacob said unto his father:1
There shall none of his meat be left:1
as it is written in the law of the LORD:1
and her hope was lost:1
before whom I walk:1
as he taught in Capernaum:1
but for father:1
And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds:1
This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts:1
thou art loosed from thine infirmity:1
no man disannulleth:1
had been done in Sodom:1
Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge:1
and every binding oath to afflict the soul:1
for he had much cattle:1
s servants came to the woman to the house:1
and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men:1
And I will delight myself in thy commandments:1
Now mine eyes shall be open:1
in the beginning of his reign:1
and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem:1
And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the ruler over them in time past:1
but woe unto him:1
and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering:1
when he was at the place:2
the snares of death prevented me:2
Neither did we eat any man:1
he hath neither child nor brother:1
He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger:1
in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant:1
As it is written in the prophets:1
s foundation:3
I heard the third beast say:1
and blot out their name from under heaven:1
And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host:1
and he was there in the prison:1
And Jesse begat David the king:1
and went out:26
and all turn to dust again:1
That every man should let his manservant:1
that triest the reins and the heart:1
and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth:1
Unto the place of the altar:1
do ye so mock him:1
But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one of you this day:1
Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump:1
So Jotham became mighty:1
and done according unto all that he hath commanded you:1
and Adalia:1
so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth:1
whose waters fail not:1
who is our life:1
she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand:1
and the fruit of thy ground:1
Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me:1
her food:3
Now these are the generations of Esau:1
So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll:1
and I shall be turned:1
and walk in lies:1
I know not the man:1
So shall ye say unto Joseph:1
and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach:1
were eight thousand and six hundred:1
and the head of Christ is God:1
And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God:1
and John:28
serve other gods:12
therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day:1
The just shall live by faith:2
For mine eyes are upon all their ways:1
And Bathsheba said:1
In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes:1
after the baptism which John preached:1
and their blood shall be poured out as dust:1
and one sat on the throne:1
both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem:1
Whence shall we buy bread:1
the mirth of the land is gone:1
and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen:1
and room for the camels:1
that he send the children of Israel out of his land:1
the fire shall burn them:1
Destruction cometh:1
And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite:1
and cut the bars of iron in sunder:1
but not into light:1
they had indignation:1
lifted up his voice:6
This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families:1
she hath mingled her wine:1
and the priest shall pronounce him clean:3
which was the son of Heli:1
And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering:1
and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion:1
And that ye put on the new man:1
And they smote him on the head with a reed:1
and subdue it:1
They shall perish:2
that were valiant men:1
that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed:1
and David beheld the place where Saul lay:1
But if ye turn unto me:1
and all may be comforted:1
this people have sinned a great sin:1
And we cast the lots among the priests:1
And when the sun is down:1
and descended from the mountain:1
into three parts:2
I will wait for the God of my salvation:1
neither is weary:1
And when he was come in before the king:1
I appeal unto Caesar:1
Among the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers:1
and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate:1
but they shall see:1
and with the other hand held a weapon:1
and every one that was in debt:1
Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him:1
as if it were of a garden:1
Therefore hear the word of the LORD:1
but thou shalt bear tidings another day:1
Peradventure there shall be forty found there:1
And the LORD was with Judah:1
that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam:1
and that her father in law and her husband were dead:1
nor give ear unto you:1
That they may teach the young women to be sober:1
and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom:1
and Shaaph:1
she conceived:16
and salt:3
Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah:1
which run to and fro through the whole earth:1
Sit thou at my right hand:1
both their:4
which the LORD hath given thee:1
count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations:1
and there is none like me:1
his offering shall be of fine flour:1
and I will hearken unto you:1
that the LORD blessed the Egyptian:1
Now while he was not yet gone back:1
and Dan:3
The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand:1
neither by any other oath:1
this was the offering of Eliab the son of Helon:1
they have holpen the children of Lot:1
but we will go along by the king:1
And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had:1
For I have eaten ashes like bread:1
to serve them:6
then thou shewedst me their doings:1
and he measured the south gate according to these measures:1
And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever:1
God gave him another heart:1
and seek after leasing:1
that he shall follow after them:1
s reward:8
Syria is confederate with Ephraim:1
s wife bare him Ashur the father of Tekoa:1
And great multitudes came unto him:1
but the heart of the foolish doeth not so:1
a very great congregation:3
he will bring me forth to the light:1
And when he had brought them into his house:1
The burden of Egypt:1
for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee:1
for there was not a house where there was not one dead:1
Paul:163
Rejoice greatly:1
Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt:1
And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies:1
but these are come to fray them:1
Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead:1
as a woman in travail:4
into the countries which thou hast not known:1
But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said:1
nor ass:1
but the LORD delivereth him out of them all:1
we are of all men most miserable:1
Let us walk honestly:1
and shall prevail:1
that I may live:3
my horses as thy horses:1
and he rose up against them:1
And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth:1
that I cried standing among them:1
trust also in him:1
And they saw the God of Israel:1
And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD:1
I am old and stricken in age:1
and carried away all the substance that was found in the king:1
and sow not among thorns:1
Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment:1
than with a brawling woman in a wide house:1
but I will meditate in thy precepts:1
If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ:1
For this purpose the Son of God was manifested:1
which caused terror in the land of the living:1
There came men unto me:1
Terrors take hold on him as waters:1
The LORD bless thee:3
and the frost by night:1
or the moon walking in brightness:1
But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD:1
and he went on:3
for they were not grown up:1
O house of Jacob:4
s half:4
and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace:1
But the bullock:1
as he said unto them:2
which went up with them into the camp from the country round about:1
as silver is tried:1
He measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another:1
I was as a beast before thee:1
they shall depart:1
Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation:1
they shall be as white as snow:1
And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah:1
and they cried before him:1
and to love his neighbour as himself:1
Now if I do that I would not:1
though we be as reprobates:1
And the children of Gad dwelt over against them:1
But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect:1
as it is fit in the Lord:1
consider her ways:1
hoofs shall be counted like flint:1
The way of an eagle in the air:1
Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons:1
and shalt not gather the grapes thereof:1
and God hath taken away my judgment:1
Yet ye say:6
we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly:1
And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies:1
I have heard what the prophets said:1
on the right side:14
Be not forgetful to entertain strangers:1
For the priests and the Levites were purified together:1
and they shall trust in the name of the LORD:1
and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul:1
forget not my law:1
the same are the children of Abraham:1
they shall surely gather together:1
he did fly upon the wings of the wind:1
which is as thine own soul:1
of iron:41
not accepting deliverance:1
So the workmen wrought:1
who is devoted to thy fear:1
where there is no standing:1
and shall add the fifth part more thereto:1
And he hath given it to be furbished:1
Which also said:1
and peacocks:2
And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days:2
And other of their brethren:1
And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment:1
that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her:1
And the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram:1
come down unto me:2
or what I did:1
And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers:1
But Aaron and his sons offered upon the altar of the burnt offering:1
therefore I said unto the children of Israel:1
and reapeth the ears with his arm:1
as I was by the side of the great river:1
But the chief priests moved the people:1
and it shall be well with you:1
Thine own friend:1
and the resurrection from the dead:1
s pool:1
But ye turned and polluted my name:1
that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers:1
which killest the prophets:1
household:66
wilt thou judge them:1
She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework:1
and one of them be gone astray:1
for one bullock:2
and there he spake with us:1
What have I now done:1
we came with a straight course unto Coos:1
And he brought the meat offering:1
that the body of sin might be destroyed:1
So Moses finished the work:1
they shall cast them forth with silence:1
and as the increase of the winepress:1
and I have prevailed:1
and Ishma:9
to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah:1
Which was the son of Joanna:1
but be somewhat dark:2
Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel:1
shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan:1
thou barren that bearest not:1
Where is the promise of his coming:1
for all the merchant people are cut down:1
they had a great while ago repented:1
For I beheld:1
and unto his father:1
and Jacob held his peace until they were come:1
They are vanity:2
and eat that I give thee:1
the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field:1
in the second month:5
and fought against it:5
and whereby they have transgressed against me:1
And these be the names of the sons of Gershom:1
Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction:1
and shall not eat of the holy things:1
put away thy wine from thee:1
Thus shall ye say unto your masters:1
I have neither lent on usury:1
and fetch olive branches:1
as God hath said:1
and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart before the LORD continually:1
and envy slayeth the silly one:1
Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David:1
he will also bless the fruit of thy womb:1
at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle:1
seven other kine came up after them:2
And for the leprosy of a garment:1
At her feet he bowed:1
for the hay is withered away:1
and Joel:6
Marsena:1
the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up:1
for thy speech bewrayeth thee:1
And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized:1
And he will take your menservants:1
And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour:1
and baked it in pans:1
Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good:1
And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand:1
and cried with a loud voice in the Jews:1
with wormwood:3
And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid:1
and I will return unto you:1
and warmed himself at the fire:1
for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God:1
as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the LORD:1
Lest ye corrupt yourselves:1
and dwelt in a several house:1
man may behold it afar off:1
and the fountains of waters:1
And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day:1
to make it withal:1
yet saidst thou not:1
and commended her before Pharaoh:1
for he shall receive me:1
I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem:1
I will lay stumblingblocks before this people:1
dread not:1
And the Philistines gathered themselves together:2
and to God the Judge of all:1
Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates:1
and the barren land his dwellings:1
and the border was drawn to Baalah:1
unto the inner court:1
and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings:1
and hath had compassion on thee:1
For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto:1
who is like thee:1
when they die:1
and eschewed evil:1
and him that had none to help him:1
so soon as I shall see how it will go with me:1
Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard:1
speaking perverse things:1
And if a woman approach unto any beast:1
and their horses flesh:1
They turn the needy out of the way:1
Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites:1
that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour:1
And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel:3
for he is a liar:1
Only the land of the priests bought he not:1
even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam:1
So that we may boldly say:1
of Reuben the firstborn of Israel were:1
And the children of Gad built Dibon:1
are an abomination unto the LORD thy God:1
and her mighty men:2
Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart:1
But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water:1
Because of the voice of the enemy:1
and in war from the power of the sword:1
Hast thou found honey:1
For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus:1
neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband:1
our God shall fight for us:1
and after that have no more that they can do:1
or famine:3
and lay them in the holy chambers:1
that I will keep thy righteous judgments:1
Even a full wind from those places shall come unto me:1
when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul:1
On the eighth day he sent the people away:1
of the LORD of hosts our God:1
Judas Iscariot:9
So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron:1
and that bringeth down the people under me:1
These were dukes of the sons of Esau:1
It shall yet come to pass:1
and gave you their land:1
is there no king in thee:1
I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger:1
which have been since the world began:1
which come to you in sheep:1
and sell the refuse of the wheat:1
on them which fell:1
that ye go not up into the mount:1
If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand:1
I am old:4
and in a cloud by day:1
who also betrayed him:1
I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem:1
and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred:1
holy and reverend is his name:1
but I kept the matter in my heart:1
neither in the synagogues:1
Er:20
or spiritual:1
and these she bare unto Jacob:1
And Obededom with their brethren:1
for in my wrath I smote thee:1
And they called them:1
that the field bringeth forth year by year:1
Who can find a virtuous woman:1
and at Ezem:1
and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb:1
the deep things of God:1
in the field of Zoan:2
and shall be shewed unto the priest:1
this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom:1
and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt:1
and the excellency of power:1
forty and two:11
he putteth down one:1
Then he called for Solomon his son:1
the king of Lachish:3
and couple the curtains together with the taches:1
so he made it again another vessel:1
that he made his sons judges over Israel:1
that there were thunders and lightnings:1
as to Jabin:1
and there is nothing in his hand:1
as he was teaching:2
Which when the brethren knew:1
or of the goats:2
he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD:1
but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body:1
they were not at all ashamed:2
the month Adar:9
which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh:1
And the scribes and chief priests heard it:1
and Sabtecha:2
that the waters should not pass his commandment:1
For there shall arise false Christs:1
and for the set feasts:1
and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash:1
that we may know him:2
though they cry in his destruction:1
we found it in the fields of the wood:1
and returned to depart:1
and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering:3
against this family do I devise an evil:1
And to have power to heal sicknesses:1
and there shall be famines:2
and revenge me of my persecutors:1
for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites:1
the lewdness of thy whoredom:1
because they saw he was a proper child:1
and his trespass:1
Which all are to perish with the using:1
I will deliver it into thine hand this day:1
asked him a question:1
and all the firstborn of beasts:1
and sweet wine:1
and the men that walk over them are not aware of them:1
For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world:1
that whosoever shall alter this word:1
O virgin:5
Be it known unto you therefore:1
Destruction upon destruction is cried:1
And when he understood that he was of Cilicia:1
Ziph:15
he cannot see the kingdom of God:1
And let him that heareth say:1
and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name:1
but they were still ill favoured:1
that he is escaped:1
and he went in:3
not for price nor reward:1
For many are called:1
even great stones:1
He built the high gate of the house of the LORD:1
yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth:1
My lord:15
and have accepted thy person:1
and it prevaileth against them:1
did not the LORD remember them:1
until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people:1
which shall not visit those that be cut off:1
and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth:1
and of them was the whole earth overspread:1
Of the half tribe of Manasseh in Gilead:1
and how many baskets ye took up:2
but so did not I:1
But Saul increased the more in strength:1
And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue:1
whom he had set at liberty at their pleasure:1
let him deliver him now:1
The LORD is good unto them that wait for him:1
and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury:1
Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land:2
And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule:1
the family of the Libnites:2
forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay:1
and said likewise:1
They had almost consumed me upon earth:1
because it was far from Zidon:1
And let it come to pass:1
and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee:1
and I after them:1
A wound and dishonour shall he get:1
then I will spare all the place for their sakes:1
Therefore Sarah laughed within herself:1
And the LORD:396
And he made chains:1
If I speak of strength:1
and another cherub on the other end on that side:1
and the priest shall make an atonement for her before the LORD for the issue of her uncleanness:1
Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts:1
regardeth it unto the Lord:1
when I smite the land of Egypt:1
hath he quickened together with him:1
He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives:1
And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long:1
that thou do as occasion serve thee:1
or Apollos:1
And thou shalt take of the blood thereof:1
and shall overcome them:1
and the steps of the needy:1
Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered:1
The thieves also:1
He bindeth the floods from overflowing:1
and Abraham went and took the ram:1
Cover us:2
and it filled the land:1
Of the children of Asher after their families:1
For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of:1
And all they of the land came to a wood:1
they must needs be borne:1
and none shall make you afraid:1
and came to the vineyards of Timnath:1
and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls:1
which giveth the sun for a light by day:1
then cometh the devil:1
And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord:1
and have believed that I came out from God:1
and became great:1
through a land that no man passed through:1
even the holy garments:1
and called all his servants:1
and encourage him:1
and Lahmam:1
ungodly men:4
brought an alabaster box of ointment:1
and terrible as an army with banners:1
And when the morning arose:1
Because thy filthiness was poured out:1
she shall be brought up:1
and against him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine:1
For I was envious at the foolish:1
And he leaped and walked:1
and hath many members:1
at the mount called the mount of Olives:1
that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind:1
the upright love thee:1
she may go and be another man:1
knowing good and evil:1
And a certain man lame from his mother:1
for thou mayest be no longer steward:1
until ye came into this place:2
that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth:1
even since the LORD spake this word unto Moses:1
Blessing:3
and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you:1
For men shall be lovers of their own selves:1
He that trusteth in his riches shall fall:1
and to do good:2
sitting over against the sepulchre:1
the same is known of him:1
and roebucks:1
but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty:1
The righteous shall never be removed:1
And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:1
I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health:1
And the angel departed from her:1
which ye shall command your children to observe to do:1
Abner the son of Ner:11
and he was a Samaritan:1
and the voice of the fierce lion:1
and it shall come to pass:13
that I may be refreshed:1
and pitched in the valley of Jezreel:1
And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward:1
And they caught every one his fellow by the head:1
because though a man labour to seek it out:1
receiveth me:8
Cursed be their anger:1
and it shall slay them:1
To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna:1
by a statute for ever throughout their generations:1
But the other of love:1
Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign:1
and were lightened:1
as a shepherd doth his flock:1
I meditate on all thy works:1
and for all the work of the house of our God:1
Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof:1
though thou wast angry with me:1
and set the city on fire:2
a good understanding have all they that do his commandments:1
I Paul have written it with mine own hand:1
and is honourable in thine house:1
Not now as a servant:1
If ye know these things:1
which regardeth not persons:1
And he hearkened unto their voice:1
Now the house was full of men and women:1
The north chambers and the south chambers:1
and discomfited all the host:1
therefore see thou mine affliction:1
ye rulers of Sodom:1
and hate her:2
and planted it with the choicest vine:1
the care of all the churches:1
then I will help thee:1
And put my cup:1
or pottage:1
and Aram:4
and the children of the devil:1
Is there not yet any of the house of Saul:1
and he shall shut it up seven days more:1
a feast of wines on the lees:1
faith:357
to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom:1
all the borders of the Philistines:1
But there was not a man among all the people that answered him:1
How is it that thou:2
that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth:1
the stick of Ephraim and for all the house of Israel his companions:1
and have been taught by him:1
will he always call upon God:1
s have bread enough and to spare:1
for all men glorified God for that which was done:1
For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom:1
Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers:1
And thou say in thine heart:1
Behold the blood of the covenant:1
And the feast of harvest:1
And as for you:1
because of the present rain:1
before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth:1
Apply thine heart unto instruction:1
which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions:1
and Stachys my beloved:1
only on that day they compassed the city seven times:1
Peradventure he will be enticed:1
The same day came to him the Sadducees:1
this is vanity:1
I am nothing:1
can he enter the second time into his mother:1
Again I will build thee:1
Yea:103
Let no man say when he is tempted:1
Therefore be ye also ready:1
then his wrath was kindled:1
whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade:1
Cornelius:10
Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes:1
and have not seen them:2
ye may be ready:1
whereby he may be made unclean:1
that Moses sat to judge the people:1
who told it unto Esther the queen:1
And the evening and the morning were the fourth day:1
and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them:1
for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith:1
And Jezebel his wife said unto him:1
He answered and said to Arioch the king:1
Stand ye in the ways:1
I am in a great strait:2
there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree:1
thou shalt conceive in thy womb:1
I am righteous:1
And when they had eaten them up:1
When the host goeth forth against thine enemies:1
and great hail:3
I will saddle me an ass:1
the child died:2
and pitched his tent:6
between them that took the war upon them:1
And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves:1
and their voice was heard:1
and his heart is lifted up in his height:1
And Jacob lifted up his eyes:1
with one chain of thy neck:1
and Cyprus:1
add to your faith virtue:1
all ye that hope in the LORD:1
So Hanameel mine uncle:1
and it was noised that he was in the house:1
and the third day I shall be perfected:1
O congregation:2
And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee:1
and Judah:33
both unto great and small:1
in all utterance:1
but that he pronounced this prophecy against me:1
before Haman from day to day:1
and they to you:1
that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness:1
for our lamps are gone out:1
And many of the people believed on him:1
and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers:1
neither hath come near to a menstruous woman:1
and it shall bring him to the king of terrors:1
yet let not Judah offend:1
the people shall curse him:1
his plague is in his head:1
and digged many wells:1
pride hath budded:1
two thousand three hundred twenty and two:1
Let burning coals fall upon them:1
and Elah the son of Uzzi:1
for they were not numbered among the children of Israel:1
for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon:1
and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work:1
tumults:3
and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD thy God:1
being over the host of the LORD:1
and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies:1
and thou:363
Yet Michael the archangel:1
And he gave him tithes of all:1
for he believed them not:1
therefore the world knoweth us not:1
When they went from one nation to another:1
for I am from him:1
and for seasons:1
do thou it for thy name:1
s letters:2
they sailed close by Crete:1
And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace:1
which they made each one for himself to worship:1
And the Lord turned:1
Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel:2
and spitted on:1
and rebuke strong nations afar off:1
She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours:1
And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah:1
and thy counsellors as at the beginning:1
For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ:1
and it shall be no more:2
and Beersheba:1
my son Absalom:3
Take you wise men:1
And they bowed down their heads:1
standing up:4
They flee before us:1
and on the south of Lebonah:1
because I have hoped in thy word:1
and the thickness thereof was four fingers:1
But other of the apostles saw I none:1
and holdest me for thine enemy:1
the LORD beheld:1
And I appeared unto Abraham:1
search the land:4
being in subjection unto their own husbands:1
from Babylon into this place:1
for God said:1
which minister unto the LORD:1
Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely:1
or pestilence:1
and as the trespass offering:1
and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters:1
in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained:1
If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands:1
s hearts failing them for fear:1
As for his father:1
The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it:1
And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt:1
And as they sat and did eat:1
And the women took the child:1
our fathers:159
and also for the lamps thereof:1
And I have led you forty years in the wilderness:1
for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom:1
None calleth for justice:1
hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness:1
and ye are strong:1
to make reconciliation for the sins of the people:1
to the chambers of the house of our God:1
the coast of Manasseh also was on the north side of the river:1
whose end is to be burned:1
which should be the LORD:1
If his children forsake my law:1
For unto every one that hath shall be given:1
and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines:1
lest he be wise in his own conceit:1
in reproaches:1
The brethren which are with me greet you:1
thou hast destroyed the wicked:1
and looked on their burdens:1
and reached to the river that is before Jokneam:1
Whereas angels:1
Dedan:12
and Anaiah:1
but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come:1
for we are well able to overcome it:1
with persecutions:1
and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand:1
and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke:1
even all the chief ones of the earth:1
and with ignominy reproach:1
but shall not find them:1
whether he be of thy brethren:1
But I have said unto you:1
and the Levite that is within your gates:1
I saw thee under the fig tree:1
because they are adulteresses:1
and there thou shalt serve other gods:1
Who shall declare his way to his face:1
There is Meshech:1
therefore have I cried concerning this:1
and a time to die:1
Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign:1
ye shall never fall:1
for God is for me:1
And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub:1
Eliel:10
and consider to whom thou hast done this:1
and they have rebelled against me:1
but the friend of the bridegroom:1
That prepareth his heart to seek God:1
s treasuries:3
if they had ought against me:1
they saw no man:2
and the elders of Israel:9
Hezron:20
But the LORD hardened Pharaoh:2
But all the congregation bade stone them with stones:1
ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave:1
and bound up his wounds:1
I will take it by force:1
which had entered into the covenant:1
s wife wept before him:1
and let them be of those that eat at thy table:1
And all the men of his house:1
And the passover:1
and took the goat:1
or children:3
And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi:1
when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle:1
speak one word unto my lord the king:1
for the LORD is a God of knowledge:1
there is that maketh himself poor:1
even when the needy speaketh right:1
Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs:1
And it was told David:2
Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son:1
for he hath no pleasure in fools:1
As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain:1
for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin:1
Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves:1
and on psalteries:1
such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time:1
Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow:1
he assayed to join himself to the disciples:1
and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah:1
even what my God saith:1
The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi:1
and they utterly destroyed them and their cities:1
And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots:1
and there was none to bury them:1
and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him:1
A man of God came unto me:1
And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God:1
And Obadiah the son of Shemaiah:1
Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem:1
so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land:1
and came to Capernaum:1
and the princes with their lies:1
And he wrote in the letter:1
for his heart trembled for the ark of God:1
which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old:1
who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession:1
either on the right hand:1
how great is that darkness:1
I considered all travail:1
but overcome evil with good:1
And wheresoever he shall go in:1
over against the gate Miphkad:1
and fitly set:1
and the way ye know:1
and what his soul desireth:1
Go up now:1
And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene:1
therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee:1
he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate:1
the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them:1
they respected not the persons of the priests:1
Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles:1
that I will raise up thy seed after thee:1
And with every living creature that is with you:1
Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering:1
To reveal his Son in me:1
But take heed to yourselves:1
when Felix came with his wife Drusilla:1
Know therefore that the LORD thy God:1
What shall I cry:1
a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering:1
seeing the root of the matter is found in me:1
And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest:1
they have made them crooked paths:1
that the sword:4
Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee:1
in charity:2
which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:1
And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord:1
which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch:1
then the LORD hath not sent me:1
and to see the business that is done upon the earth:1
For as touching the ministering to the saints:1
Naomi:21
that dwell in all the earth:2
And he denied it again:1
they gathered every man according to his eating:1
and to Bethmaachah:1
For the truth:1
And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning:1
seven days shalt thou consecrate them:1
and maketh the judges fools:1
making mention of you in my prayers:1
so that they could not so much as eat bread:1
and to trouble them:1
but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel:1
it became a young lion:1
the city was broken up:2
to compass the land of Edom:1
And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:1
then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave:1
and Bealiah:1
we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants:1
the bath of oil:1
But he:107
And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments:1
Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD:1
and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face:1
and trust ye not in any brother:1
And after this:4
Also I set watchmen over you:1
And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies:1
and he that strengthened her in these times:1
and ye defile every one his neighbour:1
and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man:1
and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings:1
for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways:1
Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth:1
who was called barren:1
whither the LORD shall lead you:1
s wisdom teacheth:1
and I will slay the last of them with the sword:1
upon one stone:3
He suffered no man to do them wrong:2
and for his brother:1
the ninth day of the month:3
and their song all the day:1
and do all his commandments which I command thee this day:1
even in troublous times:1
and seven times shall pass over thee:2
Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities:1
He is the Rock:1
Feed me:1
is in darkness even until now:1
when I shall pass through Macedonia:1
seeing he judgeth those that are high:1
s work abide which he hath built thereupon:1
love your wives:2
For so is the will of God:1
The people answered him:1
he shall gnash with his teeth:1
David:1046
A certain man made a great supper:1
But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath:1
What is my strength:1
in his season:7
Therefore the he goat waxed very great:1
I stood trembling:1
and gave provender unto the asses:1
written and engraven in stones:1
and art acquainted with all my ways:1
And kings shall be thy nursing fathers:1
it shall talk with thee:1
Behold a man gluttonous:1
he was head over a people:1
if it be a son:1
and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours:1
Her house is the way to hell:1
he will kill me:1
I called thee to curse mine enemies:1
And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done:1
what can the righteous do:1
the son of David:16
neither any that go down into silence:1
and thy mother that bare thee:1
I will stand upon my watch:1
Tell us now:1
And he fell upon his brother Benjamin:1
Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces:1
and am a witness:1
a time to keep:2
and Penuel:1
and in length as one of the other parts:1
seventy and seven lambs:1
and bless thee:3
All things are delivered to me of my Father:1
Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar:1
Some fell upon stony places:1
Their feet run to evil:1
which have been always waste:1
Malchijah the son of Harim:1
and kings to the brightness of thy rising:1
but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts:1
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet:1
and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth:1
and choose thou a place:1
and I could not stay:1
then peaceable:1
and I will make thee most desolate:1
in the day when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the priest:1
and blood came out of the winepress:1
by Eglah David:1
when he shall come in his own glory:1
wherewith he hath girded himself:1
unto the LORD in Mizpeh:1
and will cut him off:4
to do according to all that I have commanded thee:1
he shall take thee away:1
that the idol is any thing:1
therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you:1
for whom Christ died:2
of your sons:3
In stripes:1
they went down thither to him:1
unto the city of David:1
and in the commandments:1
If ye know that he is righteous:1
For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ:1
and pitched in Libnah:1
that the Father may be glorified in the Son:1
there is none that sheweth:2
How he entered into the house of God:1
Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them:1
Thou art to pass over Jordan this day:1
and are blameless:1
fearfulness affrighted me:1
charge over Jerusalem:1
captains over thousands:6
Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him:1
Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels:1
and took the body of Jesus:1
and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread:1
The God of heaven:1
which I have cast betwixt me and thee:1
even they also followed hard after them in the battle:1
Ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites:1
because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD:1
if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth:1
as a nation that did righteousness:1
And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests:1
to our princes:1
only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry:1
my lord being old also:1
Spots they are and blemishes:1
And the man did as Joseph bade:1
For the day of vengeance is in mine heart:1
nor thy son:3
or the pitcher be broken at the fountain:1
who hath trodden under foot the Son of God:1
if I have done iniquity:1
and like fullers:1
as the Lord appointed me:1
And when the day was now far spent:1
with many others also:1
s glory:49
that I may do it unto thee:2
For they are my servants:1
For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done:1
And he turned himself:2
spake Joshua:2
They have spoken words:1
them have I given thee:1
neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices:1
Who hath ears to hear:2
So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius:1
and every one by his neighbour:1
In returning and rest shall ye be saved:1
to repair and amend the house:1
This is the portion of a wicked man from God:1
Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace:1
The LORD came from Sinai:1
for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt:1
that he might humble thee:1
and sendeth her out of his house:1
even unto Rehoboam king of Judah:1
They search out iniquities:1
and into an oath:1
which is by Kedesh:1
out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image:1
and with beasts:2
and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God:1
or my mouth hath kissed my hand:1
And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain:1
or else he will hold to the one:2
According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God:1
and shall be clean:3
and took it out of the way:1
because they believe not on me:1
And they sent and called him:1
and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name:1
and they possessed it:1
as in heaven:1
and the narrow windows:1
the Egyptians marched after them:1
Both riches and honour come of thee:1
a damsel came to hearken:1
and two hundred cakes of figs:1
whether he hath seen or known of it:1
and the palmerworm:1
for theirs is thine own nakedness:1
and they cast them into the den of lions:1
but by water and blood:1
having received the kingdom:1
both for the doors of the inner house:1
whom they had desired:1
And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians:1
And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years:1
Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind:1
which he had bought and nourished up:1
that they drave them heavily:1
within a full year may he redeem it:1
and take us for bondmen:1
and will make him fruitful:1
and give it to him that hath ten pounds:1
And when she saw Peter warming himself:1
lighter:5
and took the captives:1
which my heavenly Father hath not planted:1
whom the LORD hath not defied:1
Others said:4
And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings:1
for I find no fault in him:1
one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north:1
Thou shalt not lie with mankind:1
Yet he also is wise:1
for the bread is spent in our vessels:1
But if I live in the flesh:1
which should come into the world:1
If it must be so now:1
the family of the Jahzeelites:1
Say ye to the righteous:1
Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia:1
and there were added besides unto them many like words:1
and say to Hezekiah:1
and cast out your name as evil:1
And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah:1
If thou faint in the day of adversity:1
and Libya with them:1
And when I could not see for the glory of that light:1
and hatest thy friends:1
wert graffed in among them:1
Who is my mother:2
that the mind of the LORD might be shewed them:1
in the most holy place:2
And Jesus said unto them:9
God be merciful to me a sinner:1
After him repaired Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah by his house:1
ye have caused many to stumble at the law:1
for ever and ever:46
gave unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle:1
and pitched by the valley of Elah:1
when thou wentest forth before thy people:1
when she pressed him daily with her words:1
and the end of his talk is mischievous madness:1
what Samuel said unto you:1
my sin only this once:1
nor our daughters:1
and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after:1
and grant me thy law graciously:1
Thine own wickedness shall correct thee:1
following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor:1
under the nettles they were gathered together:1
for thou hast hid thy face from us:1
to make an atonement for your souls:3
and the people did eat them with the blood:1
and the men of Israel:6
and it shall be the priest:1
And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron:1
so that it was now full:1
I foresaw the Lord always before my face:1
and understand:35
wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death:1
and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind:1
and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh:1
and went into the holy city:1
and Marcus:1
For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold of five cubits long:1
Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot:1
We have heard a voice of trembling:1
and teach me:4
when I consider:1
whom thou hast made to play therein:1
and lay it upon the cart:1
and put the taches into the loops:1
and as it were a day:1
and made thee a covenant with them:1
and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate:1
And Jacob:58
of the lookingglasses of the women assembling:1
nor of Rehob:1
they shall come out against thee one way:1
And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:1
the Bethshemite:1
And the king said unto Cushi:1
and gave them to Rebekah:1
beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty:1
I will send thee into Egypt:1
And when Asa heard these words:1
And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision:1
and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room:1
And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years:1
Absalom the son of Maachah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur:1
nor in guile:1
and when she saw the ark among the flags:1
whether thou shalt save thy wife:1
And she told her all that the man had done to her:1
God hath spoken in his holiness:2
The heads thereof judge for reward:1
But if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband:1
they shall possess it for ever:1
ask it either in the depth:1
that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together:1
and that he might send them forth to preach:1
and so forward:1
for I am the LORD their God:2
neither hath he imparted to her understanding:1
and having his head covered:1
both in the low country:1
his brother shall marry his wife:1
that which came out of my lips was right before thee:1
and called their name Adam:1
And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write:1
The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies:1
the captain of Jabin:1
Hear what the unjust judge saith:1
and go out to the field:1
which hath a dumb spirit:1
The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places:1
it may save us out of the hand of our enemies:1
For Herod feared John:1
and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ:1
which can never take away sins:1
Then said Daniel to Melzar:1
when they shall rise:2
as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers:1
And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal:1
I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter:1
as to Sisera:1
And these were the chief of king Solomon:1
this shall be the first row:1
Let not all the people go up:1
young children despised me:1
so that in the day of the LORD:1
and Jehu the son of Josibiah:1
and whose heart departeth from the LORD:1
full of grace and truth:1
and his Maker:1
nothing doubting:1
where it had not much earth:1
And Sarah said:1
from the midst of the stones of fire:1
he purposed to return through Macedonia:1
they have put no difference between the holy and profane:1
there shall no man be able to stand before thee:1
but men cast it out:1
Remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam by the way:1
which I had seen standing before the river:1
Then the king called to Ziba:1
The LORD hath taken away thy judgments:1
for to day is a sabbath unto the LORD:1
that they may eat their own dung:1
and the purple robe:1
Wisdom is better than strength:1
tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother:1
which also sat at Jesus:1
There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria:1
and in the day of the feast of the LORD:1
which see not:2
Rejoice not:4
and five on the left side of the house:1
God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day:1
Blessed be the LORD out of Zion:1
and blessed be thy glorious name:1
Or if I bring a sword upon that land:1
which devoureth round about:1
and the caul that is above the liver:2
The sons of Joseph after their families were Manasseh and Ephraim:1
And what shall I more say:1
ye deaf:1
and ye shall possess it:1
they shall roar:3
which were expressed by name:2
and they shall be safe in their land:1
And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses:1
and Ram:7
full of incense:13
that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land:1
And Tamar put ashes on her head:1
or a sacrifice in performing a vow:2
the time that I will visit him:1
If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you:1
and there Abram called on the name of the LORD:1
Neither do men light a candle:1
and for four:9
And these are they that were numbered of the Levites after their families:1
but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies:1
And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother:1
and gave them to his disciples to set before them:1
therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground:1
This shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about:1
My manner of life from my youth:1
ye his saints:2
nor condemn him when he is judged:1
Lo now:1
I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed:1
though man be born like a wild ass:1
and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves:1
which was commanded to be given to the Levites:1
Then said Paul unto him:1
the son of Berechiah:6
Flee ye:1
what shall the receiving of them be:1
where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt:1
and the LORD God of hosts was with him:1
The one and twentieth to Jachin:1
they and their men:2
and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures:1
And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick:1
they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest:1
that we should love one another:1
And the sons of Mishma:1
Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies:1
and cause you to walk in my statutes:1
he hath counsel and understanding:1
he judgeth among the gods:1
A father of the fatherless:1
the wicked bend their bow:1
by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ:1
and had utterly destroyed it:1
Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me:1
THE KING OF THE JEWS:4
And came down to Capernaum:1
nor beareth:1
cast up:14
and offered burnt offerings on the altar:1
So David reigned over all Israel:1
And Saul built an altar unto the LORD:1
but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate:1
but the bringing in of a better hope did:1
How doth the city sit solitary:1
Set ye up a standard in the land:1
And they brought the colt to Jesus:1
Then Abimelech called Abraham:1
The highway of the upright is to depart from evil:1
and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you:1
And the house of Joseph:2
I waited for your words:1
for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan:1
nor of his house:2
When Lysias the chief captain shall come down:1
And Laban said to him:1
and my beloved is mine:1
and his scent is not changed:1
and they shall flee:3
And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah:1
These were their habitations:1
I have spoken it:6
His troops come together:1
And she arose at midnight:1
Then the Amalekites came down:1
and creeping things:3
fir trees:9
which say that there is no resurrection:1
and to them that were with me:1
even with Gedaliah:1
the captains over thousands and hundreds:1
but cometh out of a far country for thy name:1
Thus did Noah:1
Then made he ten lavers of brass:1
and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids:1
which the LORD thy God shall choose to set his name there:1
the son of Omri:4
will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles:1
And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain:1
but we will build with hewn stones:1
that was about his head:1
and stood over the threshold of the house:1
and of wearing of gold:1
but the word which I have spoken shall be done:1
neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand:1
And he went out about the third hour:1
unto the camp to Gilgal:2
Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them:1
and for them:6
and a harp:1
and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll:1
and one that feareth God:1
as the LORD had commanded him:2
And Joshua passed from Libnah:1
and strengthen him:2
And Ahab said unto Obadiah:1
and all the trees of the field fainted for him:1
for I am weak:1
deceit:70
God is not the God of the dead:1
But Jesus beheld them:1
and Cappadocia:1
because I feared the people:1
And Solomon built Gezer:1
sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings:1
and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses:1
for the blood is the life:1
and have brought down all their nobles:1
for at the time appointed the end shall be:1
lest ye make yourselves accursed:1
if thou go with us:1
Whereunto I also labour:1
be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria:1
and they were destroyed from the earth:1
and behold every form of creeping things:1
and bearest not:1
and for this cause came I into the world:1
And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah:1
receiveth not me:1
But I say:18
as if a man should cast seed into the ground:1
and write fifty:1
that was in Anathoth:1
and in their tails:1
further not his wicked device:1
they called upon the LORD:1
and deliver the captives again:1
let him return and depart early from mount Gilead:1
give her the living child:1
and will yet choose Israel:1
highminded:3
Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with her suburbs:1
and how we came through the nations which ye passed by:1
I have formed thee:1
I loathe it:1
and drink his blood:1
fell down before him:3
brought no small gain unto the craftsmen:1
Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth:1
for thou shalt deal bountifully with me:1
of Eri:1
Whose leaves were fair:1
and will forgive their sin:1
For I am poor and needy:1
but thine eyes are upon the haughty:1
for he giveth not account of any of his matters:1
And the number of them that lapped:1
who only doeth wondrous things:1
and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria:1
And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah:1
for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth:1
turn from it:3
even as he is righteous:1
and made thee as the sword of a mighty man:1
and calleth for thee:1
and they were filled with water:1
And the children of Israel removed from Rameses:1
with scattering:1
In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel:1
And the whole city was filled with confusion:1
or he is pursuing:1
and those which were lunatick:1
he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins:1
So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves:1
By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us:1
well:771
how much less this house that I have builded:1
and set up the hanging of the court gate:1
and Jesus in the midst:1
there shall a man meet you:1
And I beheld:6
between the rams and the he goats:1
the sword shall be upon his arm:1
lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ:1
even unto the year of the jubile:2
even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect:1
unto Hebron:4
but not with God:1
and of your daughters:1
and abode at Hazeroth:1
Who touched me:3
it is a solemn assembly:1
with weeping:6
And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones:1
and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance:1
Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies:2
for thou wast slain:1
to dedicate it to him:1
covetous:28
But contrariwise:1
rushed forward:1
or to his seed:1
and made it a day of feasting and gladness:2
My heart is smitten:1
But Benhadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions:1
but thrust him from them:1
If thy brother trespass against thee:1
and the breastplate:1
Let me:29
neither make thyself over wise:1
For where two or three are gathered together in my name:1
which is by the river of the land of the children of his people:1
the God of glory thundereth:1
having sorrow in my heart daily:1
Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment:2
Michaiah:6
and it have turned the hair white:1
and to grieve thine heart:1
And there came a messenger to David:1
But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters:1
or daughter of thy mother:1
The remnant shall return:1
and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed:1
But as they sailed he fell asleep:1
Send me away:2
Who is like unto the beast:1
to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal:1
which they have committed in the land of Judah:1
the scribe of the law of the God of heaven:1
and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning:1
that David:34
six on each hand:1
And David took from him a thousand chariots:2
faithfully:7
Woe to her that is filthy and polluted:1
also the hundredth part of the money:1
and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees:1
and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her:1
he led him about:1
And unto Sarah he said:1
but they shall dwell safely:1
Upon earth there is not his like:1
and the oil for light:1
I establish my covenant with you:1
Then cometh he to his disciples:1
Jesus of Nazareth:16
the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently:1
and clothed thee:1
and Bashemath bare Reuel:1
Let the people praise thee:2
and will bring them again:3
and put his own raiment on him:1
For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased:1
and the spoons:5
he and four hundred men:1
Which is the first commandment of all:1
After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also:1
Again Esther spake unto Hatach:1
and they went to the battle:1
And David enquired of God:1
and she came in unto him:1
and Arioch king of Ellasar:1
for he was the firstborn of Joseph:1
of wreathen work shalt thou make them:1
the beginning and the ending:1
For the LORD had said unto Moses:1
go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock:1
and slew him on his bed:1
And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening:1
and they shall consecrate themselves:1
till the heavens be no more:1
which thou hast purchased of old:1
and tare his garments:1
I said:125
and when they shall separate you from their company:1
defer not to pay it:1
And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more:1
Jesus saith unto them:16
They shall feed in the ways:1
What thing shall I take to witness for thee:1
And not only this:1
And I answered him:1
the children of Paseah:1
the noise of their waves:1
and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches:1
that I may eat at her hand:1
and the shoulder of the heave offering:1
And he shall set up an ensign for the nations:1
where the treasures were laid up in Babylon:1
whether he be bond or free:1
So Saul took the kingdom over Israel:1
and when it is presented unto the priest:1
to open before him the two leaved gates:1
now his sons were with his cattle in the field:1
if ye hearken to these judgments:1
and cast out the wheat into the sea:1
the measure thereof shall be after the homer:1
how hath he removed it from me:1
And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish:1
And when thy days be fulfilled:1
each man according to the interpretation of his dream:2
and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them:1
this day have I begotten thee:3
All these things shall come upon this generation:1
and thou hast heard of it:1
the son of Jozadak:5
and I have shewed:1
and not declined:1
and bless us:1
Yet a little sleep:2
and the house of Israel with deceit:1
Then the LORD said unto Moses:2
My brethren:7
and a net spread upon Tabor:1
I will tell thee the mystery of the woman:1
and burning:3
and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works:1
after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah:1
and nay nay:1
And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times:1
and they shall not break their ranks:1
thou didst break:1
and they believed the scripture:1
shall not he correct:1
for we shall not else escape from Absalom:1
lest Israel vaunt themselves against me:1
whose teeth are spears and arrows:1
as they did cleanse it with the bullock:1
None eye pitied thee:1
And they laughed him to scorn:3
that the judge shall cause him to lie down:1
What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee:1
and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands:1
but how is it that ye do not discern this time:1
Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law:1
and all Israel stood:1
went before them:9
she hath not sinned:1
and for the sojourner among them:1
and every firstling among thy cattle:1
Who can open the doors of his face:1
to affright them:1
our hearts did melt:1
it will go into his hand:1
which is there at Babylon:1
I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt:1
whereof the LORD had said:1
and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him:1
and that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers:1
how savest thou the arm that hath no strength:1
I saw the LORD sitting on his throne:1
nor handling the word of God deceitfully:1
and they spoiled their tents:1
made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting:1
How is it that I hear this of thee:1
And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court:1
Now David had said:1
ye Benjamites:1
when his glory shall be revealed:1
besides Jacob:1
Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations:1
The Chaldeans answered before the king:1
Behold my maid Bilhah:1
and the two sons of Eli:2
As saith the proverb of the ancients:1
was with child:1
Suffer me a little:1
and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations:1
that even the wind and the sea obey him:1
His breath goeth forth:1
and carnal ordinances:1
And David the king came and sat before the LORD:1
Go up in peace to thine house:1
To another faith by the same Spirit:1
none evil can come upon us:1
lying down:2
they held their peace:5
for the LORD of hosts was with him:1
and poured it out before the LORD:1
and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan:1
and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father:1
and it shall be:97
and they seek my life:3
that abhor judgment:1
The lion is come up from his thicket:1
who shall set me a time to plead:1
Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah:1
after the end of two years:1
who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart:1
The righteous see it:1
if he come unto you:1
having the seven plagues:1
who was surnamed Justus:1
And I heard the number of them which were sealed:1
Thou art my Son:4
and Absalom came into Jerusalem:1
and the younger arose:1
And under the custody and charge of the sons of Merari shall be the boards of the tabernacle:1
then thou shalt be clear from this my oath:1
of mount Ephraim:6
I am come into my garden:1
and of spices great abundance:1
for they repented at the preaching of Jonas:1
And they said:95
And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver:1
I will render vengeance to mine enemies:1
that we returned all of us to the wall:1
And the Horites in their mount Seir:1
Now some are puffed up:1
and the lily of the valleys:1
and a people more than thou:1
I indeed have baptized you with water:1
and upon the children:1
proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb:1
pouring in oil and wine:1
The sons of Merari:5
And he said unto his brethren:1
And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches:1
Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee:1
to do any of these unto thee:1
and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne:1
and all the heathen shall see my judgment that I have executed:1
and ye shall slay the beast:1
saith the LORD God of Israel:18
And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate:1
and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel:1
as is the good:1
being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them:1
Then the proud waters had gone over our soul:1
and nettles had covered the face thereof:1
mine eye shall not spare:4
Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute:1
that I set before you and before your fathers:1
Now ye are the body of Christ:1
and Abihud:1
Go down to the house of the king of Judah:1
the children of Hanan:1
that we may consider them:1
I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee:1
So they built and prospered:1
holy to the LORD:2
Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east:1
at the river of Ahava:1
as an heifer of three years old:1
For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt:1
because he made himself the Son of God:1
and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot:1
for I am thirsty:1
and sent him away to Padanaram:1
Their eyes stand out with fatness:1
the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite:1
and if ye recompense me:1
if they profane it:1
I will draw my sword:1
The eyes of the LORD are in every place:1
which is upon the ark:1
Why doth thine heart carry thee away:1
but Sihon gathered all his people together:2
Give up:1
that the heavens were opened:1
Rejoiceth not in iniquity:1
that none shall pass through:1
Say ye of him:1
and desired to hear the word of God:1
even apparently:1
which assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:1
he calleth Elias:1
but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him:1
that this man was born there:1
Now when Mephibosheth:1
because thou hast taken to thee thy great power:1
but how much more unto thee:1
and made very glorious in the midst of the seas:1
and they went after other gods to serve them:1
from the great sea:2
and James the son of Alphaeus:1
and anger is outrageous:1
And the king was sorry:1
they knew the voice of the young man the Levite:1
but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof:1
and Diklah:2
or unbelievers:1
quicken me in thy righteousness:1
And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead:1
and encamped in Alush:1
nevertheless I say unto you:1
And the word of the LORD was precious in those days:1
but those that wait upon the LORD:1
and his banner over me was love:1
and in all their service:1
but it is the same God which worketh all in all:1
and the walls set up again:1
the world also is stablished:1
I fall not away to the Chaldeans:1
stripe for stripe:1
when he was determined to let him go:1
and all his sons:1
the likeness of male or female:1
Then saith Jesus unto them:1
Now therefore forgive:1
But they obeyed not:1
a prisoner of Jesus Christ:2
and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons:1
but they led him by the hand:1
Unto which promise our twelve tribes:1
and Eleazar the priest:8
To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you:1
And he looked:9
the beams:6
after the end of seven months shall they search:1
And they took their journey from Elim:1
Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves:1
and would have done sacrifice with the people:1
said God:2
Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer:1
and as I prophesied:1
and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron:1
Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man:1
And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:1
In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the threshold:1
he is risen from the dead:3
and cast it out to Joab:1
unto thee shall all flesh come:1
and out of the hand of all kingdoms:1
the battle was before and behind:1
and No shall be rent asunder:1
how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines:1
What have I done unto thee:1
there was Abraham buried:1
and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked:1
And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the LORD:1
take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer:1
yet every one of them doth curse me:1
and to which of the saints wilt thou turn:1
and the men of Jericho fought against you:1
whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle:1
the wife of Lapidoth:1
Hold fast the form of sound words:1
because I lay down my life:1
And in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish:1
Therefore if any man be in Christ:1
When I thought to know this:1
and was troubled:2
and forthwith the angel departed from him:1
and that it was pleasant to the eyes:1
and brought him forth out of prison:1
If it be possible:1
And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth:1
which ye return him for a trespass offering:1
from Jerusalem:34
yet do I not forget thy statutes:1
I am my beloved:2
that the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month:1
Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee:1
and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about:1
Thou sayest it:2
He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth:1
and there be quick raw flesh in the rising:1
I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen:1
wist ye not that I must be about my Father:1
the angel that talked with me went forth:2
then is not Christ raised:1
and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD:2
The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them:1
s name also was Athaliah the daughter of Omri:1
if not:13
and daily shall he be praised:1
And now go to:1
how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak:1
an heritage unto Israel his people:1
the earth saw:1
which is able to save your souls:1
And he hath put in his heart that he may teach:1
And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled:1
upon the altar of the LORD thy God:2
and they that hate thee have lifted up the head:1
ye that tremble at his word:1
they cover the face of the earth:1
are called:20
with your loins girded:1
they hanged the shield and helmet in thee:1
So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness:1
and his number is Six hundred threescore and six:1
and this is the gate of heaven:1
above the brightness of the sun:1
Ephraim feedeth on wind:1
that the righteous:5
we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth:1
Dabareh with her suburbs:1
I was chargeable to no man:1
calling him lord:1
and he halted upon his thigh:1
beside the sin offering of atonement:1
that the host of Syria came up against him:1
And he went to an high place:1
And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel:1
That thou doest:1
and release unto us Barabbas:1
God make the name of Solomon better than thy name:1
so am I:3
but if thou wilt enter into life:1
and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed:1
And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt:1
And the man whose hair is fallen off his head:1
that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel:1
but I laboured more abundantly than they all:1
clouds that are carried with a tempest:1
and Ashtaroth:7
and Esrom begat Aram:1
Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes:1
take heed lest he also spare not thee:1
and the bowls:4
And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim:1
and the diviners have seen a lie:1
her labour is in vain without fear:1
I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also:1
if it be possible:1
to another two:1
and the people of Israel:1
Man:201
and is to come:1
art a shield for me:1
and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls:1
the day of the LORD is darkness:1
will he keep it to the end:1
Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings:1
and graved cherubims on the walls:1
And Abraham said unto him:1
and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents:1
she shall not go out as the menservants do:1
Rejoice in the LORD:2
And they took all the spoil:1
and to speak with you:1
So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat:1
to finish the transgression:1
whom her mother bare to Levi in Egypt:1
And he answered him:6
Cry yet:1
but taking my leave of them:1
and walking in the fear of the Lord:1
Truly God is good to Israel:1
therefore they shall fall among them that fall:1
or in a freewill offering:1
saw it:36
and the gods of Syria:1
And Jonadab said unto the king:1
and God command thee so:1
And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi:1
And if the house be worthy:1
and she dwelt upon the wall:1
who were heads of the fathers of the inhabitants of Aijalon:1
I will entice him:1
and have not obeyed his voice:1
to mourn and to bury him:1
it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked:1
And if it be a female:1
and how he reigned:1
what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us:1
I have trusted also in the LORD:1
for the LORD God:8
and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel:1
I am not mad:1
And his fame went throughout all Syria:1
The silver is mine:1
and the names of his two daughters were these:1
and corrupted all their doings:1
Moreover the brasen altar:1
He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone:1
thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel:1
and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath:1
and let them that hate thee flee before thee:1
and ye see me no more:1
And I will make thee exceeding fruitful:1
and they will kill me:1
ye shall receive:9
and on the wood:1
and Joha his brother:1
I have seen the fire:1
and for the continual shewbread:1
And when he had made an end of prophesying:1
and the eunuchs:2
and to lie with my wife:1
and with a spear:1
and Makkedah:1
for thy dew is as the dew of herbs:1
for they have not rejected thee:1
but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live:1
and the hand of the LORD was there upon him:1
twelve thousand furlongs:1
and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim:1
Therefore say thou unto them:1
and all his sins:1
and they derided him:1
Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah:1
The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:1
and he made him a coat of many colours:1
there stood before the river a ram which had two horns:1
and Jahzah with her suburbs:1
because that he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel:1
and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after:1
that stretcheth forth the heavens alone:1
the children of Sia:2
how shall it be known what is spoken:1
Ascribe ye strength unto God:1
But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not:1
Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds:1
and at Jekabzeel:1
to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers:1
and from mountain to mountain:1
but they smell not:1
Also Jonathan David:1
and no man knoweth the Son:1
and leave thee naked and bare:1
What mean the testimonies:1
and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls:1
or in Ramah:1
wraths:1
seven days and seven days:1
thy wound is grievous:2
and perished in the gainsaying of Core:1
ye shall even have the great sea for a border:1
her rulers with shame do love:1
Can the children of the bridechamber fast:1
and attend to know understanding:1
believest thou the prophets:1
The wise in heart will receive commandments:1
or mildew:1
and no man shall know it:1
those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice:1
and they escaped into the land of Armenia:1
And the servant brought forth jewels of silver:1
and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people:1
And Maachah the wife of Machir bare a son:1
without the sanctuary:1
and commandments which I have written:1
saw no corruption:1
And Moses spake unto the children of Israel:2
And all the mingled people:1
and have sent me away from you:1
and it came to pass about the spring of the day:1
and proved them ten days:1
and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven:1
and then they waited on their office according to their order:1
And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the LORD:1
For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven:1
visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me:2
and the inhabitants of Jerusalem:11
which married his daughters:1
and upon their chariots:1
And Samuel came to Saul:1
and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ:1
and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD:1
Verily there is a reward for the righteous:1
that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them:1
but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD:1
that he come not at all times into the holy place within the vail before the mercy seat:1
he sent out our fathers first:1
And they said unto Moses:3
and the flax was bolled:1
And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah:1
Blessed be the LORD God of Shem:1
and that Joab the captain of the host was dead:1
But they refused to hearken:1
but in his own country:1
and his whole house:1
who had made him swear by God:1
I was greatly afflicted:1
But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee:1
Surely they are smitten down before us:1
before he had done speaking:1
and thou shalt tread upon their high places:1
Where is the house of the prince:1
Will a man rob God:1
and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD:1
So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation:1
for he hath shut their eyes:1
And Rachel said:3
for so had David the man of God commanded:1
And they clothed him with purple:1
And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron:1
and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them:1
for the powers of heaven shall be shaken:1
So again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah:1
Mine eye trickleth down:1
preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only:1
and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints:1
and likewise shalt thou make in the uttermost edge of another curtain:1
And it was a custom in Israel:1
That it is Elias:1
If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment:1
He hath shewed his people the power of his works:1
the holy Jerusalem:1
and the dragon gave him his power:1
For I will take you from among the heathen:1
Now is the Son of man glorified:1
when they cast their leaves:1
And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years:1
or of the strangers in Israel:1
the like things shall not come:1
even upon a seat by the wall:1
therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days:1
as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee:1
and the face of the sanctuary:1
Of Merari was the family of the Mahlites:1
I will satisfy her poor with bread:1
And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord:1
and himself believed:1
that God was in Christ:1
afar off from the camp:1
and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering:2
and were scattered abroad:1
having the same love:1
I will now speak unto the king:1
and from the womb:1
He said unto me also:1
We have no king but Caesar:1
Some also there were that said:1
Repent:8
And the Gentiles shall come to thy light:1
Zepho:4
and upward:47
whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose:1
Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh:1
For we have heard him say:1
put:953
Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony:1
A troop cometh:1
This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you:1
and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming:1
and sat chief:1
out of the land of Gilead:1
And he was reckoned among the transgressors:1
And Abram said unto Lot:1
And Jesus knowing their thoughts said:1
He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand:1
as they taught my people to swear by Baal:1
I will set a king over me:1
for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me:1
In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine:1
shall they fall that are slain with the sword:1
and all the Cherethites:1
She that hath borne seven languisheth:1
lo:6468
and walk in darkness:1
forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts:1
as he interpreted to us:1
And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan:1
and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats:1
nor thy fathers:4
That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men:1
whom thou didst prove at Massah:1
Helkath with her suburbs:1
and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath:1
because he humbleth himself before me:1
with very many chariots and horsemen:1
And Moses took the blood:1
as if thou hadst not received it:1
Out of the depths have I cried unto thee:1
as unto the weaker vessel:1
he departed to his own house:1
For Herod had laid hold on John:1
He brought streams also out of the rock:1
and my shame:1
The impotent man answered him:1
Go say to them:1
And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled:2
a beryl:4
thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword:1
and every tree:2
and made a crown of gold to it round about:1
in the eleventh month:1
and he came to Jahaz:1
the glittering sword cometh out of his gall:1
wherefore should God be angry at thy voice:1
and thine inheritance:4
Art thou the Christ:2
in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his name there:1
Eliathah:2
but none shall look back:1
and all the ordinances thereof:2
they were swifter than eagles:1
But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him:1
And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians:1
But the tongue can no man tame:1
and the white go forth after them:1
and all his father:3
And David was afraid of the LORD that day:1
who desire to fear thy name:1
and against thy rivers:1
then went he also up unto the feast:1
then fled they also before Abishai:1
but his servant Joshua:1
And she went forth:1
Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin:1
The first shall say to Zion:1
the LORD:5695
For by it the elders obtained a good report:1
But now I have written unto you not to keep company:1
and for Meshullam:1
but have been partial in the law:1
for the sky is red and lowering:1
These be thy gods:2
And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish:1
branch and rush:1
The thirteenth to Huppah:1
And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering:1
and upon thy people:5
when I set my face against them:1
and upon all the oaks of Bashan:1
and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD:1
for this is expedient for you:1
ye shall make it go through the fire:1
Get me this damsel to wife:1
Yet will I gather others to him:1
and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves:1
and begat Reu:1
and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah:1
lie in glory:1
And there shall be a knop under two branches of the same:1
and with many tears:1
whereof she hath said:1
and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands:1
he humbled himself:2
And the LORD said unto me:14
whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah:1
from the west side westward:1
and Zadok:10
but my Father only:1
And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him:1
and I will speak unto thee:2
when they had brought them forth abroad:1
and when she came to the threshold of the door:1
When therefore I have performed this:1
but by the law:2
and he shall take her multitude:1
but he is not there:1
He is ever merciful:1
O ye women:1
that they may receive forgiveness of sins:1
If I then:1
For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name:1
I am as a man that hath no strength:1
ten cubits from the one brim to the other:1
and the people not be afraid:1
and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land:1
and hasted and set the city on fire:1
Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help:1
for I look for him with the brethren:1
but not all:1
if he turn from his sin:1
her husband:59
Call me not Naomi:1
their oliveyards:1
In Isaac shall thy seed be called:1
Hosanna in the highest:2
And he made an hundred basons of gold:1
forbid them:4
for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience:1
he opened not the doors of the parlour:1
But he giveth more grace:1
ye have no life in you:1
s clay:2
among their dukes in the land of Seir:1
and take away the foreskins of your heart:1
that he should not see death:2
smite therefore upon thy thigh:1
and their wings:4
which shall justify the circumcision by faith:1
and made a proclamation concerning him:1
I have forsaken mine house:1
The cities of Aroer are forsaken:1
And as we tarried there many days:1
So the two men returned:1
whereby we must be saved:1
Therefore will I give thanks unto thee:1
and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish:2
it shall be for the whole house of Israel:1
And I will make my covenant between me and thee:1
to keep all his statutes and his commandments:1
And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman:1
were taken captives:2
And Moses gave unto them:1
they have not walked in them:1
And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD:1
that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim:1
and cut down their groves:2
but to love one another:1
And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof:1
For in the eighth year of his reign:1
not in tables of stone:1
Drought and heat consume the snow waters:1
s neck there in the valley:1
and set the hold on fire upon them:1
after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt:1
he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt:1
O ye kindreds of the people:1
I will walk in mine integrity:1
And the houses of Jerusalem:1
And he answering said unto him:1
the family of the Zarhites:4
it is a sweet savour:1
he falleth down unto it:1
with fear and trembling:3
now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father:1
I looked on my right hand:1
and keep all my statutes:1
and to the king of the Ammonites:1
And Sarai Abram:1
the son of Jedaiah:1
which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun:1
whom he consecrated to minister in the priest:1
and it shall be no more inhabited for ever:1
Which some professing have erred concerning the faith:1
that comforteth those that are cast down:1
but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth:1
and upbraideth not:1
I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time:1
and begat a son:2
he shall testify of me:1
seeing there is no wrong in mine hands:1
Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened:1
Let me not be ashamed:1
And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel:1
And his brethren went to feed their father:1
and thy works:2
and an hundred sheep:1
s office:36
A fool also is full of words:1
A great eagle with great wings:1
and the deceitfulness of riches:2
after he had made it a molten calf:1
that therein I may speak boldly:1
yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth:1
and all the elders of Israel:2
And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression:1
And she fastened it with the pin:1
For kings:1
and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel:1
Judah shall be carried away captive all of it:1
the Christ:18
and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled:1
till we were out of the city:1
Shammah the Harodite:1
neither have pity:1
the son in law of the Timnite:1
and to all other:1
which is the king:2
and shall betray one another:1
afore he that was escaped came:1
where there is gold:1
Jesus:977
thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul:1
nor be an help nor profit:1
until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us:1
only makest me dwell in safety:1
and grave upon it:1
and they bare children to them:1
and the Hamathite:2
And when Jesus beheld him:1
Parosh:5
for if he should leave his father:1
and of all the heathen:1
and brought to nought:1
and cast lots:3
that beheld while Samson made sport:1
And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai:3
and I of Cephas:1
because their deeds were evil:1
they wandered in deserts:1
and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:1
And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an hin of wine:1
In that ye say:1
for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day:1
And he builded an altar there:1
for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the LORD which he loved:1
they are all corrupters:1
which seeth in secret:3
Now it came to pass on a certain day:1
and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them:1
And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal:1
I can of mine own self do nothing:1
How can this man give us his flesh to eat:1
Be not wise in your own conceits:1
and famines:1
The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it:1
and send Lazarus:1
and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle:2
And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him:1
but this one thing I do:1
And the floors shall be full of wheat:1
and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded:1
and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea:1
like the army that thou hast lost:1
And the LORD God commanded the man:1
And the younger:2
and we shall be changed:1
Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob:1
What shall I do for my son:1
I will therefore chastise him:2
Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave:1
For:1767
with all their instruments:1
Knowing that he that is such is subverted:1
and so let him eat of that bread:1
To the only wise God our Saviour:1
and put him in prison for Herodias:1
Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them:1
as a leopard by the way will I observe them:1
even of your lusts that war in your members:1
And because the haven was not commodious to winter in:1
Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out:1
and all the people stood still:1
they sank as lead in the mighty waters:1
and the voice of the bride:5
and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope:1
and she shall bear upon my knees:1
This is the ordinance of the passover:1
and touched my mouth:1
They profess that they know God:1
and before whom three fell:1
What wilt thou that I should do unto thee:1
That they feared greatly:1
he fleeth also as a shadow:1
and pray toward their land:1
Many shall be purified:1
But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue:1
and believe:21
wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven:1
am the God of Israel:1
and not that he should return from his ways:1
But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins:1
A time to get:1
and unto the land of your possession:1
but to them that believed not:1
and Timna:4
wherein thou hast transgressed against me:1
and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof:1
And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary:1
and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about:1
and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever:1
neither shalt thou spare:1
yet can they not pass over it:1
And as for my flock:1
Sarsechim:1
I know thy pride:1
and a diamond:2
neither raising up the people:1
after your courses:1
And Samlah died:1
I will make them to come and worship before thy feet:1
And he smote the men of Bethshemesh:1
and see whether they be yet alive:1
for the wickedness of them that dwell therein:2
neither have they any more a reward:1
And at Jeshua:1
And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him:1
And Solomon said:3
Therefore the law is slacked:1
The nakedness of thy son:1
or if thy transgressions be multiplied:1
and all the kings of them:1
and not of us:1
and put a gold chain about his neck:1
when it had overflown all his banks:1
and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles:1
Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle:1
Arab:21
and he shall be thy servant for ever:1
and did not our God bring all this evil upon us:1
which have spoken to me:1
And when Abigail saw David:1
in making thee desolate because of thy sins:1
I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious:1
who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:1
her feet abide not in her house:1
And they turned thitherward:1
and brought him to Joshua:1
Bilgai:1
till all these things be done:1
and there was no water for the people to drink:1
And if it spread much abroad in the skin:1
this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me:1
and that they may know that this house:1
They said therefore unto him:2
and all that were with him:1
And the men:46
Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth:1
even Moses shewed at the bush:1
wherein the plague is:3
and all thine army:1
for they were no gods:1
and swear falsely:1
bearing the sanctuary:1
It is thou:1
and upon his house:1
for I am ready not to be bound only:1
All nations compassed me about:1
Thus saith the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite:1
so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury:1
who dwelt in Heshbon:1
and looked upon thee:1
which is a worm:1
Else if ye do in any wise go back:1
and from Eziongaber:1
therefore made he thee king:2
And they spake unto Moses:1
for he hath said:1
and set them on fire:1
and his dens with ravin:1
and all of them by their names:1
that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes:1
and all the world may become guilty before God:1
and make prayers:1
Neither shall there be any work for Egypt:1
and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry:1
And Benaiah brought the king word again:1
And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:1
he shall be my servant:2
because ye build the tombs of the prophets:1
s words that he had spoken unto me:1
I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD:1
and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever:1
and there were lightnings:1
As we have heard:1
In like manner also:1
What confidence is this wherein thou trustest:1
and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead:1
that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers:1
God himself that formed the earth and made it:1
and their soul shall be as a watered garden:1
and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel:1
they ceased not from their own doings:1
is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered:1
and to agree:1
and be holden in cords of affliction:1
fear ye not the reproach of men:1
and stole him from among the king:1
And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:1
and she came unto him:1
and receiveth not my words:1
Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me:1
get thee down quickly from hence:1
for they knew all that his father was a Greek:1
I have put my spirit upon him:1
and thou shalt be a blessing:1
Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany:1
for they cannot do evil:1
And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel:1
preaching peace by Jesus Christ:1
and put a pillow of goats:1
there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion:1
But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you:1
and we came to Kadeshbarnea:1
Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred:1
and with all thy strength:2
Whose feet they hurt with fetters:1
Now it came to pass after the death of Saul:1
shall be in thine heart:1
The LORD killeth:1
Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge:1
that he should touch them:1
And shall lay thee even with the ground:1
and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods:1
but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God:1
I am of Apollos:1
and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering:1
For they eat the bread of wickedness:1
Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake:1
and they spake to the people:1
These are murmurers:1
and he will shew them his covenant:1
but his brethren had not many children:1
and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp:1
and Anathoth with her suburbs:1
Duke Aholibamah:2
and their overseer was Zabdiel:1
he shall smite the land of Egypt:1
for I have determined there to winter:1
Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon:1
sin lieth at the door:1
and before his angels:1
Brethren:12
and covered the land of Egypt:1
that I have not done in it:1
Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee:1
Say thou unto them:1
Break off the golden earrings:1
When thou passest through the waters:1
At that time the LORD said unto me:1
ye careless daughters:1
with all the children of Ephraim:1
and Hazarsusim:1
and the dry land:3
ye are yet in your sins:1
to have been continually before me:1
neither have I desired the woeful day:1
lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil:1
and from the streets of Jerusalem:1
And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba:1
before the day was I am he:1
even to them which stumble at the word:1
and he burnt Hazor with fire:1
Then said Pilate unto him:1
he shall see it:1
and suffered not the devils to speak:1
Zabad the son of Ahlai:1
s song in a strange land:1
and give me meat:1
And all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the LORD:1
and to make his instruments of war:1
And he that overcometh:1
And Elijah said:6
he vexed them:1
and with your seed after you:1
yet they prepare their meat in the summer:1
and Athaliah reigned over the land:1
he shall pour no oil upon it:1
and have forsaken me:1
Ponder the path of thy feet:1
And the king called for Jehoiada the chief:1
bless the LORD:11
for then would I fly away:1
for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem:1
Cappadocia:2
Now we know that thou hast a devil:1
and offered a sacrifice unto the LORD:1
And the rest will I set in order when I come:1
And the land rested from war:1
and will make him a sign and a proverb:1
If I say:3
and we compassed mount Seir many days:1
To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife:1
And thou shalt grope at noonday:1
scribes:68
and he delivered them out of their distresses:1
it is a spreading plague:1
great lords and renowned:1
prayers:24
and the city that is in the midst of the river:2
and heareth my sayings:1
except he interpret:1
and pitched in the mountains of Abarim:1
But the lad knew not any thing:1
for the LORD hath spoken:10
and how long will it be ere they believe me:1
and went into the house of the LORD:1
and pitched at Rimmonparez:1
they wearied thee:1
My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness:1
and they turned in thither:1
because they made the calf:1
but having hope:1
kindness:78
even unto Saul:1
he is in the house of Machir:1
which they had marked for themselves in the daytime:1
and bewailed her:2
when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon:1
that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel:1
and he sat thereon:1
Ebedmelech went forth out of the king:1
And threescore and twelve thousand beeves:1
after he had buried his father:1
and from all the mountains of Judah:1
But ye have not so learned Christ:1
that disciple was known unto the high priest:1
to him whom man despiseth:1
s chariots:23
Also I say unto you:1
and the daughter of Caleb was Achsa:1
but stand thou still a while:1
And the priests and the Levites purified themselves:1
and captains of hundreds:3
and she shall be made whole:1
But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave:1
that Pharaoh dreamed:1
and walk therein:1
the words which he had spoken unto the king:1
but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever:1
the daughter in law against her mother in law:3
Afterward shall the children of Israel return:1
each one walking in his uprightness:1
and the God of peace shall be with you:1
And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths:1
with the freewill offering of the people:1
and the sceptre of the rulers:1
they shall run:4
that the nations may tremble at thy presence:1
For they have sown the wind:1
and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate:1
from which we are not cleansed until this day:1
according to the work thereof:2
but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD:1
And by thy sword shalt thou live:1
because of the evil of your doings:3
a spirit taketh him:1
They have now compassed us in our steps:1
All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers:1
a king shall reign in righteousness:1
Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him:1
the cup also shall pass through unto thee:1
Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God:1
which is in the end of the year:1
Then shall the righteous answer him:1
even from Babylon:1
saw these men:1
men of understanding:4
And the servants of Saul told him:1
and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup:1
The former treatise have I made:1
Zerahiah his son:1
and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people:1
I will wash mine hands in innocency:1
and all this people:2
for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh:1
and sojourned there with a few:1
and all their bows bent:1
and it had palm trees:1
And it came to pass at midnight:1
The same came to Jesus by night:1
and all the people after him:1
the LORD hath set a king over you:1
but life in you:1
But they shall serve the LORD their God:1
and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence:1
for he is faithful that promised:1
and entered into Judah:1
and the Ishmaelites:1
and will not save them by bow:1
Though the root thereof wax old in the earth:1
every man to his tribe and to his family:1
Jesher:1
Though all men shall be offended because of thee:1
And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years:1
then I will go to the left:1
why hast thou set me as a mark against thee:1
but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken:1
and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself:1
for therefore am I sent:1
s sons come:2
how many thousands of Jews there are which believe:1
this is nothing else but sorrow of heart:1
all came to pass:1
whom he hated not in time past:1
and maketh the day dark with night:1
according to the number of the tribes of Israel:1
And being let go:1
and houses:2
And Moses said unto the children of Israel:1
but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself:1
We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof:1
of Bethany:1
turn again to these thy cities:1
and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude:1
The thing that thou doest is not good:1
and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill:1
and he that speaketh lies shall perish:1
and astonishment of heart:1
And the evening and the morning were the third day:1
to take the spoil:3
I also will choose their delusions:1
For David speaketh concerning him:1
A light to lighten the Gentiles:1
for the LORD hath sent thee away:1
and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates:1
so would we have it:1
and happy are these thy servants:1
Then took I the cup at the LORD:1
king of Babylon:114
but as it were in secret:1
and left neither man nor woman alive:1
sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:1
his tent:33
do the work of an evangelist:1
but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean:1
s office in his father:1
and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world:1
another esteemeth every day alike:1
and of fowls:1
My daughter is even now dead:1
even he is the eighth:1
I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime:1
and strangers of Rome:1
And straightway the father of the child cried out:1
according to the commandment of the everlasting God:1
which they had gotten in the land of Canaan:1
with the harp:3
And thou shalt speak my words unto them:1
unto whom the LORD had sent me:1
Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly:1
saw two brethren:1
And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed:1
that would come from thence:1
and beckoned with the hand unto the people:1
I called upon thy name:1
A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof:1
there have they dealt treacherously against me:1
but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel:1
and put it on the cross:1
and he knew not ought he had:1
And there was a famine in the land:2
And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD:1
and many sleep:1
And I will be found of you:1
And the children of Israel set forward:2
whatsoever any man giveth the priest:1
Of the sons of Bani:1
as showers that water the earth:1
we have had enough to eat:1
And he made ready his chariot:1
and burn them in the fire:1
for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread:1
Thy nakedness shall be uncovered:1
we have one Father:1
or that my mother might have been my grave:1
The meek will he guide in judgment:1
and they cleansed the chambers:1
Is any man called being circumcised:1
according to this judgment shall it be done unto him:1
because my word hath no place in you:1
The daughters saw her:1
that thy Son also may glorify thee:1
and I am a smooth man:1
As a dream when one awaketh:1
ye shall say:17
and to his disciples:1
Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel:1
Doth not he see my ways:1
and let thine handmaid:1
and that our Lord is above all gods:1
the spear:17
That ye may eat the flesh of kings:1
and encamped in Haradah:1
And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel:1
and stood:54
as with the taker of usury:1
on the sides of the north:1
And nets of checker work:1
and she became famous among women:1
and I have loved thee:1
and among the Philistines:1
yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans:1
On the east three gates:1
he will bring me again:1
ye ministers of his:1
may Israel now say:1
after that tribulation:1
And Moses said before the LORD:1
and as an high wall in his own conceit:1
and did live:1
as the trumpeters and singers were as one:1
not made with hands:2
that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more:1
Who hitherto waited in the king:1
where abode both Peter:1
a palace of strangers to be no city:1
Though he had commanded the clouds from above:1
And every little chamber was one reed long:1
thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the LORD thy God:1
thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision:1
and opened the doors of the house:2
Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib:1
and look upon the face of thine anointed:1
which made heaven:3
after that she shall go:1
he prepared it:1
and he will dwell with them:1
we cannot tell what he saith:1
the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip:1
by the hand of him whom thou wilt send:1
Lest they drink:1
He walked also after their counsel:1
and for the house that I shall enter into:1
As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet:1
s sons that were slain:1
and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom:1
Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade:1
and likewise silver by weight for every bason of silver:1
Zethar:1
and his commandments:6
It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:1
who can tell him:2
how will he then vex himself:1
that they might put us to death:1
for I will not take that which is thine for the LORD:1
He directeth it under the whole heaven:1
and to all the people that were with him:1
but they could not shew their father:2
and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians:1
neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth:1
But he said:12
And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh:1
and all the land of Goshen:1
the flaming flame shall not be quenched:1
or not:20
We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites:1
the son of Bechorath:1
and her maidens walked along by the river:1
Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people:1
and read in the book of the law of the LORD their God one fourth part of the day:1
and heard him read the prophet Esaias:1
I have sinned against the LORD your God:1
and were appointed for all the work of the place most holy:1
call a solemn assembly:2
thou art he that took me out of my mother:1
and the idol out of the house of the LORD:1
and the LORD deliver them before me:1
But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head:1
and before his ancients gloriously:1
which God giveth him:2
Be ye followers of me:1
The stranger did not lodge in the street:1
who appeared unto him:1
For then will I turn to the people a pure language:1
and we will be Pharaoh:1
even mine enemies and my foes:1
and all the plain by Medeba:1
But to us there is but one God:1
and yielded almonds:1
Simon Peter went up:1
even they and their men:1
A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth:1
Of the sons of Beriah:1
The children of Lod:2
For I also am an Israelite:1
and of long continuance:2
and he cried unto the LORD all night:1
hair for the tent over the tabernacle:1
take thee a tile:1
and Abdon the son of Micah:1
and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel:1
Arphaxad:10
I will answer:8
and five cubits the height thereof:1
for our iniquities are increased over our head:1
which is strong:2
threescore and eight:2
Even him:1
when she came to him:1
I will cause men to walk upon you:1
was come to go in unto the king:1
and thou hast increased and waxen great:1
And he burnt sweet incense thereon:1
and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue:1
Put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices:1
and the woman was very beautiful to look upon:1
Who covereth the heaven with clouds:1
Thou hast burned this roll:1
nor defile yourselves with their idols:1
and went to Ramah:1
Even from the mount Halak:1
thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field:1
being brought before kings and rulers for my name:1
for dust thou art:1
joy:216
shall be defiled as the place of Tophet:1
and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers:1
And David distributed them:1
and the people wept that night:1
Then said Jesus unto the twelve:1
as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle:1
there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem:1
for they have observed thy word:1
all faces shall gather blackness:1
and my servant David a prince among them:1
for the people had a mind to work:1
it shall he take away:5
neither shall the sun light on them:1
and his life shall be unto him for a prey:1
and now tell you even weeping:1
and the service of God:1
And Isaac his father answered and said unto him:1
even they shall perish from the earth:1
to go to meet the king:1
then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel:1
and praised God:1
For he looketh to the ends of the earth:1
and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up:1
or a dreamer of dreams:1
and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour:1
that one of the old prophets is risen again:1
and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews:1
and my people shall never be ashamed:2
for he was cut off from the house of the LORD:1
And Pharaoh called unto Moses:1
if by any means he be missing:1
Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth:1
s sakes:2
and make not provision for the flesh:1
that our old man is crucified with him:1
they of the house of Israel say:1
Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me:1
the father of Milcah:1
and the governor asked him:1
Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly:1
They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes:1
seeking of him a sign from heaven:1
therefore will I give men for thee:1
he shall surely live:9
At the west side four thousand and five hundred:1
as her soul was in departing:1
but died in his own sin:1
The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them:1
they set them before the council:1
as ye yourselves also know:1
they did not hear:3
being baptized with the baptism of John:1
Who is he that overcometh the world:1
with cherubims of cunning work shalt thou make them:1
they that war against thee shall be as nothing:1
Take thee a young calf for a sin offering:1
and to restore every man:1
So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD:1
and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt:1
This is the day which the LORD hath made:1
that he might know wherefore they cried so against him:1
after your weeks be out:1
and after one day the south wind blew:1
Because the spoiler is come upon her:1
and three cubits on that side:1
their sister:11
and the city shall be in the midst thereof:1
our money in full weight:1
And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon:1
and thy seed after thee in their generations:2
While the sun:1
even as also ye do:1
and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory:1
but not by thy covenant:1
And there was a sore famine in Samaria:1
And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be unclean until the even:1
I have blessed him:1
And having an high priest over the house of God:1
And I will set up one shepherd over them:1
saith the LORD GOD:2
but thou art the same:1
and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains:1
that I may dwell among them:2
And when we cried unto the LORD:2
that eat:31
then thou shalt give life for life:1
and all that was therein:2
so their root shall be as rottenness:1
and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land:1
the child shall die:2
And as he sat upon the mount of Olives:2
in the multitude of thy mercy hear me:1
he that created the heavens:1
instead of her:3
and ye shall sow the land:1
The fool foldeth his hands together:1
but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence:1
to set them among princes:1
Philistia:3
who was shut up:1
Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still:1
seeing thou hast not withheld thy son:1
and he laid hands on him:1
I will not be an healer:1
And David made him houses in the city of David:1
the dream is one:1
For his letters:1
lamentation:28
for to go up to the high place:1
and thou shalt take thy rest in safety:1
Moon:1
When the LORD shall stretch out his hand:1
Thou God seest me:1
Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals:1
A land of darkness:1
And he said unto the woman:1
and the pots in the LORD:1
and the sons of Zebedee:1
and a nourisher of thine old age:1
Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting:1
when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about:1
What a word is this:1
Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet:1
and the light of thy countenance:1
Surely I am more brutish than any man:1
so that none can pass through them:1
hath one that judgeth him:1
for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee:1
suffering the vengeance of eternal fire:1
and wheels:1
And to them it was given that they should not kill them:1
and go not in the way of evil men:1
And I will smite the winter house with the summer house:1
and the demand by the word of the holy ones:1
and do them:20
in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us:1
there is but a step between me and death:1
they conspired against him to slay him:1
For God is my King of old:1
And they shall be afraid:2
I would not that ye should be ignorant:1
And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished:1
Let us go into the house of the LORD:1
with the statutes and judgments:1
When the whole earth rejoiceth:1
in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow:1
s whelps have not trodden it:1
let me go and pay my vow:1
So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand:1
the strength of the hills is his also:1
For our heart shall rejoice in him:1
in blue clothes:1
the son of Ithiel:1
whatsoever she asked:2
and his life from perishing by the sword:1
and Salathiel begat Zorobabel:1
they feared greatly:2
because he was little of stature:1
And a certain man saw it:1
they rebuked them:1
when it shooteth forth:1
and not cover it:1
that by my voice I might teach others also:1
thou art gone backward:1
and in it was meat for all:2
For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead:1
I have brought unto thee my son:1
and let them tell thee now:1
or to confiscation of goods:1
S tribute was thirty and two persons:1
and have dominion:2
The children of Kirjatharim:1
Give a portion to seven:1
All things that the Father hath are mine:1
Baanah:10
and take them:5
even in his own city:1
and if he said thus:1
did Joshua take:2
but patient:1
And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel:1
Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field:1
Which was the son of Matthat:1
I stretch forth my hands unto thee:1
Will he make many supplications unto thee:1
that it might depart from me:1
the father of David:1
s sons presented unto him the blood:2
But he that doeth truth cometh to the light:1
For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness:1
shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days:1
and in her tongue is the law of kindness:1
and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts:1
and ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD seven days:1
and did fly:2
and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings:1
to stir you up by putting you in remembrance:1
when I have respect unto all thy commandments:1
I fear my lord the king:1
out of two hundred:1
that the temple might be built:1
and when he is come:1
He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person:1
my heart maketh a noise in me:1
there came no such almug trees:1
and hath made thee ruler over them all:1
and an angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD:1
And Aaron said:4
And there are differences of administrations:1
I know not the LORD:1
the seers hath he covered:1
in great abundance:3
and crucify him:1
While the Pharisees were gathered together:1
he espied his money:1
that we should serve in newness of spirit:1
but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body:1
and sit down quickly:1
in building you an altar beside the altar of the LORD our God:1
and built Penuel:1
they married wives:1
and drew away much people after him:1
they shall eat thy fruit:1
Their horses also are swifter than the leopards:1
and of the beeves:1
but thou shalt be desolate for ever:1
My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee:1
and thou sewest up mine iniquity:1
And thou shalt make the horns of it upon the four corners thereof:1
and the LORD gave them unto me:1
that use their tongues:1
but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen:1
We have made a covenant with death:1
for your enemies shall eat it:1
that house cannot stand:1
as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh:1
I tell you that he will avenge them speedily:1
and none can deliver:1
and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem:1
And Saul said unto his servants:1
And two chains of pure gold at the ends:1
and the Holy One of Israel is our king:1
There were together Simon Peter:1
into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD:1
My soul shall make her boast in the LORD:1
and will observe these things:1
but the lamp of the wicked shall be put out:1
s feet:77
and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there:1
that I should reign:2
Eliasaph the son of Deuel:4
Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood:1
and afterward go your way:1
Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John:1
that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem:1
but if ye worship not:1
they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent:1
Go forth now to meet Ahaz:1
Therefore it became a proverb:1
and he weigheth the waters by measure:1
Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep:1
Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful:1
and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance:1
He shall put on the holy linen coat:1
For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also:1
And this said:1
which was the son of Adam:1
he did eat no bread:1
The blessing of the LORD be upon you:1
twelve years:10
the high priest:61
and Naphtali:6
and sixteen daughters:1
and every plague:1
which shall burn upon you:1
he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him:1
and he also with whom the cup is found:1
how long will it be ere thou be quiet:1
but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him:1
the tree of life also in the midst of the garden:1
for false witnesses are risen up against me:1
and son:7
yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD:1
Miriam became leprous:1
And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are:1
as Reuben and Simeon:1
God:4040
Neither shalt thou swear by thy head:1
garments:98
and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten:1
Because the Lord hath need of him:1
and they of that place:1
And out of the tribe of Gad:2
When shall I arise:1
and five sheep ready dressed:1
and their brethren the sons of Kish took them:1
I will raise up against Babylon:1
For we have found this man a pestilent fellow:1
so shall it be easier for thyself:1
and shall devour the whole earth:1
My foot hath held his steps:1
throughout their families:8
it was meet for no work:1
I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart:1
that they may serve me:6
That the kingdom might be base:1
Then said the Jews:6
when she bare him:1
Why hast thou made me thus:1
therefore will he teach sinners in the way:1
John indeed baptized with water:1
and all the people that are with him:2
But the men that went up with him said:1
he will visit their sins:1
And the thing was very grievous in Abraham:1
And God did so that night:1
let Tamar my sister come:1
And it came to pass the same day:1
that it may be before thee for ever:1
Mahalaleel:7
and Elishua:2
and no man breaketh it unto them:1
And Aaron said unto Moses:2
and of all the people that dwelleth in this city:1
whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her:1
in the fourth year of Solomon:1
and he that condemneth the just:1
Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man:1
he hath filled his belly with my delicates:1
if I come again:1
O inhabitant of Mareshah:1
for thine own sake:1
and the Sadducees:2
and a colt with her:1
So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel:1
Now it came to pass upon a day:1
s rod:16
they glorified the Lord:1
and did spread them abroad:1
Unto whom David said:1
and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand:1
even as unto thee:1
and from thy people:1
and of the cunning workman:1
and said unto the first:1
to swear that they should do according to this word:1
and the mouth taste his meat:1
And now I say unto you:1
and who is the sword of thy excellency:1
And they cried out the more exceedingly:1
Whosoever denieth the Son:1
All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables:1
and Jahaziel:2
if the dead rise not at all:1
But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance:1
The children of Neziah:2
For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth:1
shall the matter be established:1
which was:321
And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden:1
than that we should die in the wilderness:1
for Ekron one:1
After that he is sold he may be redeemed again:1
and bring in little:1
And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom:1
Princes also did sit and speak against me:1
and sailed into Syria:1
they fall down:1
because all the people was astonished at his doctrine:1
fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites:1
and did as they were taught:1
And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked:1
the children of Asaph:2
nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul:1
Even such as he is able to get:1
but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines:1
their names being changed:1
and wounded him:2
Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah:1
and his father was a man of Tyre:2
He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods:1
I am young:1
before the priests and the judges:1
That this night:1
and he strengthened me:1
And thou shalt take the Levites for me:1
let not the proud oppress me:1
and Jeziah:1
which had the writer:1
and that person be guilty:1
and ye take from him burdens of wheat:1
and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace:1
and shew my people their transgression:1
And Paul:8
and drink no water:1
Consider how I love thy precepts:1
Get thee out of thy country:2
and to the men of Israel:1
and they brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt:1
when I plead with thee:1
as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon:1
do all to the glory of God:1
and went into another place:1
and shalt stone them with stones:1
weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you:1
and to destroy it from off the face of the earth:1
shall surely come to pass:1
The LORD hath done great things for them:1
for that is delivered unto me:1
and purified the altar:1
Ephraim is a cake not turned:1
that stand by the LORD of the whole earth:1
livest after the manner of Gentiles:1
and given to the poor:2
and to God the things that are God:1
because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD:1
the sinews of his stones are wrapped together:1
I have counsel and strength for war:1
for all her household are clothed with scarlet:1
and goeth into the mountains:1
for the cities thereof shall be desolate:1
For we are made partakers of Christ:1
They are upright as the palm tree:1
When I applied mine heart to know wisdom:1
and he departeth:1
Unto thee will I cry:1
far or near:2
And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:1
for I desire to justify thee:1
little children:15
So Esther arose:1
and entering into the ship again departed to the other side:1
And the people asked him:1
in remembrance of his mercy:1
and in the temple:1
Then the priest shall look:4
when he crieth unto me:1
And he left the linen cloth:1
One woe is past:1
And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive:1
and stones to be set:4
And unto Adam he said:1
and the apparel:1
Therefore for all the words of this letter:1
Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles:1
By faith Noah:1
and he will understand knowledge:1
and have also caused their sons:1
tell this:2
And I will persecute them with the sword:1
have corrupted themselves:3
Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth:1
and bless the LORD:2
and of men an hundred thousand:1
neither shall it be valued with pure gold:1
that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary:1
Ye are holy unto the LORD:1
And where is now my hope:1
and I will tear them from your arms:1
and let him be your fear:1
both men and women:4
But when Jesus saw it:1
The wind hath bound her up in her wings:1
and treadeth upon the high places of the earth:1
to make a sweet savour unto the LORD:1
O all flesh:1
Take heed:33
And the man waxed great:1
And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years:1
it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck:1
and pass quickly over the water:1
And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents:1
and he shaved himself:1
and for thy pleasure they are and were created:1
was it which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel:1
for he offereth the bread of thy God:1
and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch without:1
Now upon the first day of the week:1
neither shall they come in unto you:1
and have not kept the commandments:1
for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate:1
and Ithran:3
and to commit fornication:1
neither are your ways my ways:1
The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Gentiles:1
for it is written:9
For he is our God:1
therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day:1
when he was in circumcision:1
And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon:1
thou sluggard:1
And whosoever shall not receive you:2
there was a sharp rock on the one side:1
And Omri went up from Gibbethon:1
and rejoiced in the works of their own hands:1
And Jesus departed from thence:1
from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled:1
And there was no day like that before it or after it:1
whether it be oven:1
and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel:1
Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good:1
that thou wilt not let them go:1
when the LORD carried away Judah and Jerusalem by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar:1
Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it:1
s uncle said:2
For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest:1
At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh:1
Wherefore I take you to record this day:1
neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth:1
the strength of Egypt:1
when he saw what was done:1
I will give thanks unto thee for ever:1
and declare thou unto me:2
because the children of Israel strove with the LORD:1
which was guide to them that took Jesus:1
and barley:3
Moreover concerning a stranger:1
all the princes sat there:1
thou seekest to go to thine own country:1
in the feast day:1
Mark:11
Drink ye:3
against the day of my burying hath she kept this:1
the half of my goods I give to the poor:1
when I come unto you:1
He hath blinded their eyes:1
that ye tell him:1
let his enemies be scattered:1
and lightly esteemed:2
or bright spot:1
and the land of Og king of Bashan:2
He shall enter into peace:1
thou shalt shine forth:1
I will lay thy cities waste:1
and the valley of Keziz:1
Moses:841
even the offering of the house of our God:1
For I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed:1
or his day shall come to die:1
He delighteth not in the strength of the horse:1
Strive to enter in at the strait gate:1
and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth:1
Of the Gershonites were:1
Moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah:1
of Amok:1
and pitched in mount Shapher:1
and their oxen:1
and Zadok the scribe:1
that the LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken:1
And the disciples were filled with joy:1
And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam:1
Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish:1
So did David:1
salute it:1
till thy people pass over:1
But they were the ruin of him:1
or whether they will forbear:3
and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity:1
And I was with you in weakness:1
attend unto my prayer:1
Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction:1
After him repaired Benjamin and Hashub over against their house:1
that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon:1
and Pharaoh:6
so do to Jerusalem and her idols:1
And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies:1
and every man his maidservant:1
And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey:1
And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh:1
and all the children of Israel with him:1
and Nimrah:1
This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth:1
And they sat down:4
when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh:1
that they watched him:1
enter thou into thy chambers:1
and Abraham his servant:1
but live:2
Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes:1
When I come again in peace:1
and of his father:1
judge thee:8
beside harts:1
your shoes on your feet:1
and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations:1
And he made the ephod of gold:1
And if the righteous scarcely be saved:1
that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice:1
but in the Hebrew:1
for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written:1
even of the tabernacle of testimony:1
and they fortified Jerusalem unto the broad wall:1
and waxed a great tree:1
and the space was one cubit on that side:1
God judgeth the righteous:1
which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles:1
and they are gone without strength before the pursuer:1
now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD:1
And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face:1
and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him:1
and am not silent:1
and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold:1
did great wonders and miracles among the people:1
or for son:1
thou art the guide of my youth:1
and every bondman:1
or the eye of his maid:1
So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel:1
Now the sons of Keturah:1
when thou didst march through the wilderness:1
and let me alone:1
The LORD therefore be judge:1
who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death:1
And David cried to the people:1
Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist:1
And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man:1
shall it declare thy truth:1
that he die not:3
until thou have consumed them:1
and the Sidonians:1
that she might fly into the wilderness:1
they empty themselves upon the earth:1
the son of Korah:2
So when David was old and full of days:1
and the name of his brother was Sheresh:1
three hundred and ninety days:2
Tabeel:1
and to all that were in his house:1
and great noise:1
which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem:1
shame hath covered our faces:1
and cometh not again:1
with the cup of astonishment and desolation:1
Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep:1
what shall we speak:1
and earth upon them:1
and kept close from the fowls of the air:1
And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia:1
for we be brethren:1
the Spirit:138
and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace:1
and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood:1
and the head of Damascus is Rezin:1
and that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm:1
and my servants:3
for thy servant knew nothing of all this:1
and his face as the appearance of lightning:1
and I have done wickedly:1
as Tirzah:1
but they discovered a certain creek with a shore:1
when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee:1
even unto the end of the world:1
and anointed himself:1
and also shalt still prevail:1
and the sound that goeth out of his mouth:1
Let the damsel abide with us a few days:1
that he made with the children of Israel:1
ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away:1
he hath made me desolate and faint all the day:1
And they rose up in the morning early:1
because he hath done great things:1
But the Egyptians pursued after them:1
all the males from a month old and upward:1
There is no healing of thy bruise:1
have not I held my peace even of old:1
and hast forgotten God that formed thee:1
And five of you shall chase an hundred:1
Remember the days of old:1
whom Mordecai:1
and their officers:3
So Esther drew near:1
And the border from the sea shall be Hazarenan:1
and because of the abominations which ye have committed:1
and wells digged:1
and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him:1
and he shall go forth from thence in peace:1
it toucheth thee:1
Mine eyes fail for thy salvation:1
Let him be crucified:2
that I will do judgment upon her graven images:1
gathered themselves unto him:1
Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment:1
and all these things are come upon thee:1
Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps:1
Gog his son:1
and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies:1
Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons:1
What is that to us:1
and we will take your daughters to us:1
and Shilhim:1
and cast them out of the city:1
Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them:1
how long will ye turn my glory into shame:1
for he is lunatick:1
and sent him away empty:3
Bless them which persecute you:1
the son of Meshillemoth:2
and builded Nineveh:1
and hath conceived mischief:1
for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven:1
but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai:1
out of the armies of the Philistines:1
The barrel of meal shall not waste:1
and my bones are burned as an hearth:1
Therefore was he hired:1
And they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised:1
thou hast not lied unto men:1
and the daughters of the famous nations:1
for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee:1
but destroyed it utterly:1
do it:50
And the sons of Kenaz:1
and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth:1
I will not eat:3
And Micah said unto him:2
they trusted:4
unholy:4
And he put all upon Aaron:1
for it is holy unto the LORD:1
That they gathered themselves together:1
who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth:1
they said unto him:27
when Rachel had born Joseph:1
and dwell therein for ever:1
because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:1
and all that she had:2
for there they blessed the LORD:1
by whom shall Jacob arise:2
and prayed the third time:1
And when they had numbered:1
when ye come together to eat:1
and camels:8
so God hath requited me:1
and the words of Haggai the prophet:1
that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel:1
But Moses hands were heavy:1
that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures:1
Pride goeth before destruction:1
I and my people:3
And Achish said:4
yet I give my judgment:1
Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come:1
Who will render to every man according to his deeds:1
And his armourbearer said unto him:1
three tenth deals shall ye offer for a bullock:1
If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath:1
I am black:3
he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time:1
and praise thy glorious name:1
and Ham:17
and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee:1
for this thing is done of me:1
and behold a fourth beast:1
and of the flock:2
For my love they are my adversaries:1
then had thy peace been as a river:1
And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh:1
and for the praise of them that do well:1
Let us pass:3
to wife:45
one beloved:1
I call:35
and it was told Abimelech:1
whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock:1
s daughter:87
and there was a very great slaughter:1
but my people know not the judgment of the LORD:1
and brought them back into the guard chamber:1
Shimei his son:3
Take heed therefore unto yourselves:1
Provideth her meat in the summer:1
that he did it by night:1
and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom:1
and cry unto the LORD:1
that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north:1
and in the moon:1
And from the wicked their light is withholden:1
He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house:1
what have I to do with thee:1
and consorted with Paul and Silas:1
and the rulers:7
And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the LORD out of all nations upon horses:1
Rejoicing in hope:1
and he hath sent me:1
Art thou the King of the Jews:4
for a living dog is better than a dead lion:1
and upon the loins sackcloth:1
which hath kept me back from hurting thee:1
nor reprove another:1
Now the Jew:1
before him whom he believed:1
and two bottles of wine:1
until the indignation be overpast:1
When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it:1
coming to him:2
the LORD thy God hath not suffered thee so to do:1
yet his father made him the chief:1
Why was this waste of the ointment made:1
But unto the Son he saith:1
and to take away his sackcloth from him:1
And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah:1
that kept the entrance of the king:1
and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word:1
for what have I done:2
that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem:1
are all workers of miracles:1
Who then is Paul:1
They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them:1
taking occasion by the commandment:2
remove thy foot from evil:1
And they all condemned him to be guilty of death:1
and did wipe them with the hairs of her head:1
that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it:1
and have passed through the gate:1
and the evil way:1
And they made a calf in those days:1
heard his words:1
and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean:1
neither was there spirit in them any more:1
to vex her:1
and their prospect was toward the south:1
And he made an house of high places:1
that ye might have a second benefit:1
As every man hath received the gift:1
Bethsaida:7
The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD:1
For first of all:1
that they are vain:1
and certain others with them:1
and my heart is faint:1
yet he knoweth not:1
He that is far off shall die of the pestilence:1
and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon:1
the words of my mouth:9
Bring up this people:1
from that time that thine ear was not opened:1
it was fifty cubits long:2
The LORD rebuke thee:1
for ye shall laugh:1
He pursued them:1
and bound themselves under a curse:1
so shall also the coming of the Son of man be:3
Therefore his people return hither:1
and Ardon:1
and they shall seek peace:1
and Benjamin:28
and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:1
whatsoever they were:1
that he may send away your other brother:1
Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters:1
that Obadiah took an hundred prophets:1
and let them go:5
both he and they:1
seeing all the people were in ignorance:1
But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven:1
And if ye will receive it:1
to the mighty One of Israel:1
with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery:1
like a destroying lion:1
and all the instruments:4
And he opened his mouth:2
because in his days the earth was divided:1
and walked:16
And when he had opened the fifth seal:1
and they succeeded them:2
being arrayed in white linen:1
For he was wiser than all men:1
then shall he offer it before the LORD:1
Sit down now:1
The lady of kingdoms:1
Take me up:1
And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death:1
and to all that are afar off:1
and entered by the gate of the valley:1
And immediately he arose:1
So shall thy barns be filled with plenty:1
Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better:1
The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah:1
that he shall play with his hand:1
and they shall follow them:1
and made him king:4
that thou by them mightest war a good warfare:1
But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us:1
By whom:3
Ask ye now:2
that have no ruler over them:1
the son of Imri:2
because he had compassion on his people:1
and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven:1
for they are thine:1
and the flood came:1
that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger:1
but their iniquities shall be upon their bones:1
the new wine:10
that he should sanctify the most holy things:1
that we might work the works of God:1
And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel:1
s supper:1
they comforted them:1
And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem:1
thine eyes are upon me:1
Thou hast wrought iniquity:1
thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword:1
Ye shall henceforth return no more that way:1
the family of the Merarites:1
for consider how great things he hath done for you:1
dwelt in their cities:2
I will not go in with thee:1
then come thou:1
to whom thou barest witness:1
and were captains in the host:1
And Esau ran to meet him:1
Husbands:2
For all the gods of the people are idols:1
Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of Canaan:1
And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower:1
but the greatest of these is charity:1
Our hand is high:1
and put him in prison till the day of his death:1
And give thee the blessing of Abraham:1
and put an omer full of manna therein:1
the same wheels also turned not from beside them:1
and turned back:2
or peradventure he sleepeth:1
For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians:1
having every one of them harps:1
He that putteth not out his money to usury:1
but a lying tongue is but for a moment:1
My righteousness is more than God:1
For I rejoiced greatly:1
set thy words in order before me:1
this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her:1
and to make a firm decree:1
When thou liest down:1
And Abram went up out of Egypt:1
And Hilen with her suburbs:1
thou that leadest Joseph like a flock:1
and weep before me:1
and have mercy upon Zion:1
But as an hired servant:1
Now thanks be unto God:1
for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah:1
not take their daughters for our sons:1
be troubled:12
his understanding is infinite:1
they conceive mischief:1
And delivered him out of all his afflictions:1
Thou that art full of stirs:1
and came unto thee:1
And when the children of Israel heard it:1
And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua:1
and cities which ye built not:1
who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah:1
took up the bed:1
but David and his men passed on in the rereward with Achish:1
his head with his legs:1
but my salvation shall be for ever:1
and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat:1
for without me ye can do nothing:1
he is thy brother:2
Grace to you and peace from God our Father:1
ye have reigned as kings without us:1
thou didst well in that it was in thine heart:1
and there fell some of the people of the servants of David:1
Mashal with her suburbs:1
do not this abominable thing that I hate:1
whether his work be pure:1
none did compel:1
and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick:1
with all the saints which are in all Achaia:1
and not to please ourselves:1
they cast them into prison:1
the LORD gave her conception:1
and turned again unto Pihahiroth:1
for great is the anger and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced against this people:1
They shall not know:1
nevertheless for the oath:1
and every mountain and hill shall be made low:1
and he will shew the interpretation:1
And upon this came his disciples:1
and told his two brethren without:1
for Gaza one:1
And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature:1
And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin:1
it was a dream:2
The length of one curtain shall be eight and twenty cubits:1
I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation:1
that Cain rose up against Abel his brother:1
because they had found no answer:1
and found no water:2
so with her mistress:1
And leaving Nazareth:1
there were their breasts pressed:1
And he also had made savoury meat:1
and in the rocks:2
For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country:1
for it came of God:1
And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire:1
And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel:1
I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon:1
Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth:1
and found there a well of springing water:1
Pashur:14
And Abraham stretched forth his hand:1
Therefore said some of the Pharisees:1
If mine heart have been deceived by a woman:1
to cover it:2
and the sockets of the court gate:1
their appearances and themselves:1
Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father:1
and merciful:6
and Dedan:5
as it is said:2
And Jotham ran away:1
Get you into your land:1
But all the silver:1
What are the names of the men that make this building:1
I have set her blood upon the top of a rock:1
Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation:1
Then the priest of Jupiter:1
fifty and two thousand and seven hundred:1
Of whom be thou ware also:1
neither rend your clothes:1
and it shall remain in the midst of his house:1
Hast thou eaten of the tree:1
in Benjamin:4
upon them:181
and was strong:2
all the souls were seven:1
and teach the Gentiles:1
and rose again:2
and concerning their reproach:1
and pour you out a blessing:1
Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein:1
nor break any bone of it:1
When ye come together therefore into one place:1
to do no work therein:1
Ye that have escaped the sword:1
which are not convenient:2
Have ye not read so much as this:1
and have profaned mine holy things:1
And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done:1
let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David:1
each of you his censer:1
and the dead ox also they shall divide:1
and caused every man his servant:1
the tent which he placed among men:1
let him go over with my lord the king:1
and thy glory above all the earth:1
touch no unclean thing:1
The sons of Reuel:1
Have I conceived all this people:1
I am he that came out of the army:1
and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem:1
and having nothing to eat:1
but their heart goeth after their covetousness:1
I have set thee over all the land of Egypt:1
Thy will be done:2
Therefore Saul removed him from him:1
and thy words:2
that are far from righteousness:1
Cast forth lightning:1
the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud:1
and they returned and said:1
and to the rushing of nations:1
and know and see his place where his haunt is:1
Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding:1
for the tabernacle of witness:1
beryl:8
fight against them that fight against me:1
and it is now increased unto a multitude:1
and lay in his bosom:1
even threescore cities:1
And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes:1
if ye will not hearken unto me:3
cut it down:3
and Amalek:3
for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house:1
there is none that heareth your words:1
And Jacob said unto Joseph:1
that he profane not my sanctuaries:1
two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the LORD:1
he that reproveth God:1
a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs:1
He turned their heart to hate his people:1
even so deal with me:1
For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found:1
ten in a cubit:2
Azariah the son of Jeroham:1
a taunt and a curse:1
And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him:1
They shall come all for violence:1
every day his portion:1
as their fathers did keep it:1
and hid it by Euphrates:1
thou false tongue:1
I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities:1
he sent Joab:2
And this was their appearance:1
and shall drive him to his feet:1
Because it entereth not into his heart:1
and the other lot for the scapegoat:1
surely God will not do wickedly:1
Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled:1
that there was a famine in the land:1
which was the son of Joseph:3
And he offered the burnt offering:1
And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust:1
for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away:1
whom the Father hath sanctified:1
and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city:1
had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach:1
and shall consume the earth with her increase:1
whose name was Irijah:1
dost thou not watch over my sin:1
and unto every good work reprobate:1
for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen:1
or of pomegranates:1
neither shall he deliver any by his great strength:1
and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof:1
The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them:1
and do according to his will:1
God shall smite thee:1
if the scall be spread in the skin:1
and the truth of the LORD endureth for ever:1
a captive:1
none shall pass through it for ever and ever:1
that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself:1
If men strive:1
that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death:1
he let out the vineyard unto keepers:1
and lay thine hand upon him:1
Because of mine house that is waste:1
Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee:1
hath walked in my statutes:1
forget also thine own people:1
His left hand should be under my head:1
to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites:1
and he also was born to the giant:1
and abode there till even before God:1
The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him:1
he openeth his eyes:1
Gareb the Ithrite:1
saving the beholding of them with their eyes:1
for with a strong hand shall he let them go:1
and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction:1
claws:3
and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him:1
when he was born:1
Though I might also have confidence in the flesh:1
Jacob shall rejoice:2
concerning the house of Jacob:1
And a certain scribe came:1
on teaching:1
he shall in no wise lose his reward:1
and the grasshopper shall be a burden:1
who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel:1
And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites:1
and for gold:1
Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies:1
and an hissing:4
And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller:1
walk ye in it:1
he hath also forsaken you:1
she nourished her whelps among young lions:1
also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil:1
albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides:1
His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire:1
and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom:1
a female from the flock:1
And Zechariah:2
nigh unto thee:3
Having yet therefore one son:1
and taketh away the understanding of the aged:1
and a fat land:1
And he stripped off his clothes also:1
Then if any man shall say unto you:1
The things which are impossible with men are possible with God:1
he will yet again leave them in the wilderness:1
for the right of redemption is thine to buy it:1
that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died:1
and the water of affliction:1
My skin is black upon me:1
this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel:1
Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband:1
and afflicted me:1
but that he loved us:1
because he delighted in me:2
a nation whose language thou knowest not:1
he had given his hand:1
if he be in the land:1
These are the words of the covenant:1
Meraioth his son:1
then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague:1
Ehi:1
Hashub:5
and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt:1
which opened to them of his own accord:1
should I accept this of your hand:1
and not wake:2
have ye another brother:1
and cut down your images:1
At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick:1
For he remembered his holy promise:1
the instruction of a father:1
a chalcedony:1
The LORD is righteous:4
there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews:1
which knew not the LORD:1
judge righteously:2
to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot:1
And when thou hast accomplished them:1
like a sharp razor:1
And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab:1
but forgat him:1
Hearing of thy love and faith:1
but with us is the LORD our God to help us:1
And I will give power unto my two witnesses:1
I sit a queen:1
are there yet any more sons in my womb:1
which was Simon:1
But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal:1
they were ashamed and confounded:1
Babylon is taken:1
nor to cleanse:1
that I might keep thy word:1
Wailing shall be in all streets:1
the hand of God was very heavy there:1
And ye know that with all my power I have served your father:1
they killed also the lambs:1
and if there be any iniquity in me:1
Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian:1
and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession:1
and to reap his harvest:1
but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment:1
All men cannot receive this saying:1
the king sat him down to eat meat:1
For our sakes:1
but Christ Jesus the Lord:1
at the rebuke of five shall ye flee:1
And to them which were in Aroer:1
It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment:1
because our days upon earth are a shadow:1
and thy paths drop fatness:1
and healed all that were sick:1
and Paseah:1
For we can do nothing against the truth:1
Hear me:10
For I say unto you:8
beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant:1
and thou shalt possess it:1
The night is far spent:1
and he shall be blessed upon the earth:1
and the chief captain also was afraid:1
sing praises unto his name:1
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem:1
and strangled for his lionesses:1
therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee:1
Helez the Paltite:1
Exalt the LORD our God:1
mighty:336
and bowed down to their gods:1
Therefore I said:3
and would have made his defence unto the people:1
I am an husbandman:1
and they fell upon them:1
and came unto him:3
which are upon her:1
The city of destruction:1
Because the people come unto me to enquire of God:1
Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes:1
if a man for conscience toward God endure grief:1
And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt:1
And when they had mocked him:1
depart ye:1
and the Levites to their charges:1
For thou hast made of a city an heap:1
the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge:1
a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent:1
And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight:1
and they are strong:1
who transgressed in the thing accursed:1
according to all that he promised:1
in brass:7
and I have made it for myself:1
if the will of God be so:1
have mercy on me:5
let my brother Amnon go with us:1
and Jachan:1
So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone:1
That John the Baptist was risen from the dead:1
Let them be confounded and troubled for ever:1
I shall be slain in the streets:1
And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall:1
No lion shall be there:1
and Noah begat Shem:1
and ye shall be saved from your enemies:1
and to what are they like:1
These are the true sayings of God:1
and with the signet of his lords:1
but there is hallowed bread:1
and teachest the way of God in truth:1
And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethaneel the son of Zuar:1
and their charge shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest:1
And Solomon slept with his fathers:2
but if thou mayest be made free:1
By thee have I been holden up from the womb:1
and hardened our heart from thy fear:1
because it is holy:1
LORD God of Abraham:4
else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old:1
for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword:1
that call not thou common:2
Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not:1
they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness:1
Thus will I bless thee while I live:1
and to the king of Shimron:1
cities great and fenced up to heaven:1
And say to Archippus:1
and have gone and served other gods:1
In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks:1
and turn thee eastward:1
bring it unto me:2
they laid the sick in the streets:1
and slew the Philistines:2
which always causeth us to triumph in Christ:1
Where is the God of judgment:1
and worketh it with the strength of his arms:1
Cursed be he that smiteth his neighbour secretly:1
Let his children be fatherless:1
And all the people came before the king:1
And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests:1
If he turn not:1
Simon Peter saith unto him:1
They said:12
Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem:1
and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them:1
a man greatly beloved:1
his day:354
but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt:1
What man is that which said unto thee:1
when his wife:1
Hearken:29
And there were also two other:1
and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies:1
And whosoever doth not bear his cross:1
I will now say:1
For the moth shall eat them up like a garment:1
disappoint him:1
and to their posts within the gate round about:1
for the LORD had made them joyful:1
and the breadth of every side chamber:1
that we may fight together:1
Then Pilate therefore took Jesus:1
s sons grew up:1
Surely the mountains bring him forth food:1
every one a ruler among them:1
even the law of commandments contained in ordinances:1
then is the prey of a great spoil divided:1
and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers:1
and satyrs shall dance there:1
when thou sendest him away free from thee:1
And Zacchaeus stood:1
going to carry it down to Egypt:1
O taste and see that the LORD is good:1
Yet hast thou not walked after their ways:1
For though I made you sorry with a letter:1
and the remnant of Syria:1
Nor yet that he should offer himself often:1
a good for a bad:1
Upon me be thy curse:1
some sixtyfold:1
Then Judah came near unto him:1
and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king:1
If thou at all take thy neighbour:1
how shall I defile them:1
and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand:1
They shall eat their bread with carefulness:1
and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee:1
having a matter against another:1
and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself:1
it shall be measured to you again:2
neither observe their judgments:1
But these five kings fled:1
He asked life of thee:1
Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame:1
dividing the water before them:1
the son of Pashur:3
and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing:1
Spake I not unto you:1
and for their goods:1
and the kite after his kind:1
before the great and terrible day of the LORD come:1
my father:140
and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai:1
and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth:1
that he had said that he would do unto them:1
even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast:1
if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:1
after that I have plucked them out I will return:1
the vail shall be taken away:1
for there is no saviour beside me:1
And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity:1
and that which they had not heard shall they consider:1
and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them:1
thou south:1
that I said unto her:1
and pass on to Zin:1
this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness:1
This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen:1
Because I was not cut off before the darkness:1
because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight:1
Etam:5
even so is the man also by the woman:1
and counsel from the ancients:1
and healing every where:1
and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORD:1
and taught them:3
but a stranger shall not eat thereof:1
as long as he is a child:1
nor perceived by the ear:1
And to carry the silver and gold:1
For thus saith the LORD God of Israel:2
and in three days I will raise it up:1
Marvel not that I said unto thee:1
A man shall not be established by wickedness:1
Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi:1
and serve us:1
and his fury upon all their armies:1
after the work of the ephod thou shalt make it:1
and I lay a stumbling-block before him:1
Let him that stole steal no more:1
To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me:1
But think on me when it shall be well with thee:1
and ten thousand of barley:1
and they said:18
and when they sought him:1
and lambs:2
which is Bethlehem:1
In the day that thou stoodest on the other side:1
the idol which he had made:1
In whom ye also trusted:1
and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt:1
which they stripped off for themselves:1
When Christ:2
do good to them that hate you:1
and exercise thyself rather unto godliness:1
and their treasures upon the bunches of camels:1
Take Aaron and Eleazar his son:1
But if our gospel be hid:1
he shall bring forth judgment unto truth:1
and brake it:5
a deep sleep fell upon Abram:1
The field of blood:2
s money was in the mouth of his sack:1
though they be not circumcised:1
So I came to Jerusalem:1
but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire:1
Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah:1
and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth:1
s knees:8
and pulled Lot into the house to them:1
And if he smite him with an instrument of iron:1
and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague:1
Thy signet:1
Then his father and his mother said unto him:1
which I have given you:4
O LORD God Almighty:1
and cursed as he went:1
and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures:1
Beautiful for situation:1
of whom it is witnessed that he liveth:1
that I may rejoice in the day of Christ:1
neither shall his place know him any more:1
I have yet many things to say unto you:1
And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty:1
Surely:85
they shall blow an alarm for their journeys:1
what is my sin:2
and hath given him power to eat thereof:1
and not understand:1
and every sin offering of their:1
from our youth even unto this day:1
And cast him out of the city:1
If thou be the king of the Jews:1
but utterly destroyed all that breathed:1
after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them:1
the one for the burnt offering:1
Babylon hath been a golden cup in the LORD:1
be not afraid of him:1
he is there:1
He sitteth alone and keepeth silence:1
and tread the morter:1
And they forsook the LORD:2
and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king:1
And when he came into the house:1
and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness:1
Now there was found in it a poor wise man:1
and power:26
which make a farthing:1
and brake the trees of their coasts:1
and his Holy One for a flame:1
Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom:1
They sacrificed unto devils:1
And behold joy and gladness:1
and the border went about eastward unto Taanathshiloh:1
to smell thereto:1
Blessed is the man whom thou choosest:1
then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:1
seven hundred forty and three:1
till ye have scattered them abroad:1
according to the twelve tribes of Israel:2
and was not found:1
so do stripes the inward parts of the belly:1
and the next day to Neapolis:1
ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month:1
and shall tremble at every moment:1
That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs:1
And he will take the tenth of your seed:1
Then the men of Judah gave a shout:1
As the LORD hath been with my lord the king:1
leave us not:1
two hundred rams:1
Then shall we know:1
and they came to Egypt:1
and see what thou doest:1
even Pharaoh and all his multitude:1
for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem:1
But it displeased Jonah exceedingly:1
for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day:1
and it shall be an altar most holy:2
judge me:3
I am come unto thee:1
and when he goeth out:1
according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye do:1
both Philip and the eunuch:1
And from thence they went to Beer:1
For when they came into the house:1
And the Lord said unto him:3
Stand in the gate of the LORD:1
glory to the LORD God of Israel:1
being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip:1
yet will I not make a full end:1
and now when shall I provide for mine own house also:1
and I sware to him by the LORD:1
And the letters were sent by posts into all the king:1
And the time drew nigh that Israel must die:1
and the firepans:2
according to his glorious power:1
I was brought low:1
in a land that was not sown:1
nor put frankincense thereon:1
from the throne:1
and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah:1
and Ohad:2
their land is also full of horses:1
and one king shall be king to them all:1
Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice:1
one of his disciples said unto him:1
and is fallen into the ditch which he made:1
All that found them have devoured them:1
the length thereof was threescore cubits:1
made master of the magicians:1
and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls:1
and two thousand pound of silver:1
And they removed from Dibongad:1
the strife ceaseth:1
and royal wine in abundance:1
and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom:1
I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath:1
And thou shalt say:9
Thou makest darkness:1
your captains of your tribes:1
and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel:1
binding and delivering into prisons both men and women:1
and shall cleave unto his wife:1
in the ninth day of the month at even:1
he said unto his disciples:5
and the two posts:1
Let now the astrologers:1
must have a thousand:1
And thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain that is outmost in the coupling:1
for he is Lord of lords:1
that I may recover strength:1
and to your children:1
Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father:1
and chop them in pieces:1
therefore thou shalt surely rejoice:1
or a man whose seed goeth from him:1
he hath broken the covenant:1
and they shall be drunken with their own blood:1
seeing thou doest all these things:1
that thy judgments are right:1
when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem:1
all the women that are left in the king of Judah:1
and they sanctified holy things unto the Levites:1
And this he said to prove him:1
For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the offering of the corn:1
Lust not after her beauty in thine heart:1
So do God to Abner:1
they shall put it in their hand:1
therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan:1
and despised others:1
from Anab:1
the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word:1
And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah:1
and the censers of pure gold:1
If it do evil in my sight:1
What thinkest thou:2
now there was a valley between them and Ai:1
and they set down the ark of God:1
whereby they have sinned against me:1
nor going out:1
Declare ye in Egypt:1
Thy throne:3
She goeth unto the grave to weep there:1
Can one go upon hot coals:1
who passed by:1
And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah:1
Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked:1
keep that thou hast unto thyself:1
and Jekuthiel the father of Zanoah:1
And Abraham answered and said:1
and drink not wine nor strong drink:1
and made all the congregation to murmur against him:1
and harps and psalteries for singers:1
were threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred:2
for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone:1
s builders did hew them:1
And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea:1
for he hath heard your murmurings:1
choose you a man for you:1
the family of the house of David apart:1
and Lebanon:5
but put thou on thy robes:2
Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites:1
judge thou my cause:1
Truly this was the Son of God:1
and Adithaim:1
If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight:1
that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah:1
they builded:4
or in uncircumcision:1
And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho:1
Many are my persecutors and mine enemies:1
and when those were lifted up from the earth:1
It is truth:1
so that they sent this word unto the king:1
And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness:1
and his grate of brass:1
So his father went down unto the woman:1
Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto this day:1
and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore:1
for they feared the people:2
It is good for me that I have been afflicted:1
nor give to God a ransom for him:1
because we would not be chargeable unto any of you:1
neither will I be with you any more:1
upon the horses:1
Be favourable unto them for our sakes:1
Charity never faileth:1
the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves:1
feign thyself to be a mourner:1
nor from the west:1
When he prepared the heavens:1
so will we do as thou sayest:1
but knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth:1
and how I bare you on eagles:1
he is hid now in some pit:1
sent unto Hoham king of Hebron:1
there thou hast that is thine:1
Therefore sprang there even of one:1
Peace:28
the LORD said unto him:21
And they came unto John:1
Now therefore give pledges:1
for ye serve the Lord Christ:1
Is thine eye evil:1
that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery:1
which are the prayers of saints:1
his righteousness endureth for ever:3
the stones would immediately cry out:1
And Jonadab said unto him:1
and what wisdom is this which is given unto him:1
and Mered:1
being a chief man among his people:1
and with the sound of the trumpet:2
passed over armed before the children of Israel:1
the son of Shimeah David:2
fret not thyself in any wise to do evil:1
for a sweet savour before the LORD:1
And he asked the scribes:1
that divided the sea:1
why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy:2
and they shall come again to me:1
so they did speedily:1
For if the dead rise not:1
but being high priest that year:1
and of the vexation of his heart:1
believe also in me:1
for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul:1
for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself:1
and his skin:1
And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan:1
and without understanding:1
higher than the kings of the earth:1
then I will shew it thee:1
may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:1
few or many:1
and I wondered that there was none to uphold:1
and the Levites flayed them:1
with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men:1
to possess the dwellingplaces that are not their:1
Art thou that prophet:1
and brought them:29
and escape:9
and build the house of the LORD thy God:1
for the day of their calamity is at hand:1
when he is come:4
And he prayed again:1
and lay not upon us innocent blood:1
thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth:1
s heel:4
and am set down with my Father in his throne:1
Lie with me:2
And the king said unto him:9
So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen:1
thou that preachest a man should not steal:1
and your young men shall see visions:1
that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee:1
disobedient to parents:2
and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel:1
why do I yet suffer persecution:1
peradventure it was an oversight:1
Then are they glad because they be quiet:1
yet are they turned about with a very small helm:1
now ye are rich:1
and turn their reproach upon their own head:1
whatsoever uncleanness he hath:1
and set up a standard:1
and toward Jazer:1
and in earth:4
even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD:1
Do we begin again to commend ourselves:1
incline thine ear unto me:3
And when he had lifted up his eyes:1
An hundred measures of wheat:1
but save his life:1
How shall the ark of the LORD come to me:1
thou hast redeemed me:1
and ye shall see me:3
And he said unto her:13
At that time Merodachbaladan:1
If thou know not:1
And if the plague come again:1
that they also might be sanctified through the truth:1
that might lay his hand upon us both:1
and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame:1
a place of a skull:1
And the maid went and called the child:1
s sheep at Bethlehem:1
let him be hanged thereon:1
from the greatest of them even to the least of them:1
spread abroad his fame in all that country:1
Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel:1
and Shebna the scribe:3
But the LORD is my defence:1
and sent forth:3
shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him:1
disciples:245
and the God that answereth by fire:1
but yield yourselves unto the LORD:1
for an heave offering of the LORD:1
and brought it upon us:1
Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king:1
and wine bottles:1
that my people is taken away for nought:1
Knowest thou not what these be:2
Ginnetho:3
and as the green herb:1
but was manifest in these last times for you:1
The door posts:1
not with chains:1
and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers:1
and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment:1
Now these are the generations of Pharez:1
Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand:2
but new wine must be put into new bottles:1
because our dwellings have cast us out:1
And he had two wives:1
Consider ye:1
throughout all their journeys:1
and not the face:2
from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias:1
by themselves:15
Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee:1
I hear that there be divisions among you:1
and the Levites wait upon their business:1
and to knock at the door:1
because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle:1
which thou hast ordained:1
and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out:1
and Ahimoth:1
Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil:1
and brought gifts:4
than that he should offend one of these little ones:1
Therefore the LORD shall have no joy in their young men:1
sister:134
and bring it to me:1
and it shall be exalted above the hills:1
which keepeth truth for ever:1
that he will make him ruler over all that he hath:1
Of all meat which may be eaten:1
And these signs shall follow them that believe:1
But to them that rebuke him shall be delight:1
For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication:1
Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot:1
He brought me to the banqueting house:1
They have not known nor understood:1
there the LORD shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies:1
For the tabernacle of the LORD:1
and said unto the king:4
And many believed on him there:1
that hath come upon us:1
and preaching the gospel of the kingdom:2
Duke Kenaz:2
Jesus therefore:10
nor his parents:1
for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me:1
and lifted up his eyes to heaven:1
and see now:1
what think ye:2
by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me:2
So the chief captain then let the young man depart:1
Cast ye up:1
And they took strong cities:1
For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you:1
And they rose up early in the morning:1
there sat women weeping for Tammuz:1
and she met them:1
and wished in himself to die:1
if the rising be white in the skin:1
and maketh diviners mad:1
we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD:1
and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah:1
So then after the Lord had spoken unto them:1
And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath:1
I have no husband:2
I cannot rise and give thee:1
now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place:1
when Joshua was by Jericho:1
He is dead:2
and overran Cushi:1
nor to the nobles:1
which is the book of life:1
and was in the house of Micah:1
thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee:1
s tent:40
and passed over the river:1
for what I would:1
that they may be most holy:1
therefore he blessed you still:1
The city of confusion is broken down:1
and two other with him:1
So is this people:1
I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever:1
out of thy book which thou hast written:1
Now his elder son was in the field:1
that shall he speak:1
The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness:1
and if the dew be on the fleece only:1
and for the kings of Syria:2
and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna:1
in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens:1
Why herein is a marvellous thing:1
and make his throne greater than thy throne:1
And the LORD said to Hosea:1
for therefore are ye come to your servant:1
and shewed me that great city:1
Hearken unto the voice of my cry:1
and began at the same scripture:1
his work is perfect:1
and at the hand of man:1
that there be no wickedness among you:1
And in mercy shall the throne be established:1
And her adversary also provoked her sore:1
and standeth to judge the people:1
and carry it forth in the twilight:1
And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian:1
but ye have not obeyed my voice:2
and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain:1
for though he was not the firstborn:1
after the manner of the Zidonians:1
nor knew his own children:1
and make you fruitful:1
the word of the LORD is against you:1
in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone:1
wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed:1
and seal them:1
even all the men of Ai:1
Nation shall rise against nation:1
so the feebler were Laban:1
Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon:1
then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels:1
that this word came unto Jeremiah from the LORD:1
and the men of war:3
and it come to pass:2
his enemy:5
I made a covenant with mine eyes:1
therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD:1
Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law:1
Thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him:1
that I may boast myself a little:1
Sent:1
Peace be to this house:1
and the elders of the people:2
but every small matter they judged themselves:1
All ye beasts of the field:1
on the wilderness:1
that should make up the hedge:1
Then said Agrippa unto Festus:1
And Joseph wept when they spake unto him:1
And I have set there a place for the ark:1
as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they:1
and Seraiah begat Joab:1
and let them which are in the midst of it depart out:1
king of Heshbon:10
And the saying pleased the king and the princes:1
Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep:1
acceptable unto God:1
and Israel strengthened himself:1
And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram:1
And Janum:1
And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria:1
that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses:1
and three hundred chariots:1
and are not:8
Who comforteth us in all our tribulation:1
and with trumpets:3
I will never leave thee:1
and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah:1
and straightway took his journey:1
When ye come to appear before me:1
yet I will look again toward thy holy temple:1
and they that were with him:8
And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks:5
bless the lads:1
Nehemiah:8
which glory was to be done away:1
How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD:1
and liftest up thy voice for understanding:1
And that no man might buy or sell:1
and the asses:2
For to this end also did I write:1
Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down:1
and yielded their bodies:1
Who changed the truth of God into a lie:1
and will bring them against this land:1
Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem:1
Hagar:16
and turn this day from following the LORD:1
I will fear no evil:1
whatsoever things are honest:1
Pour out thine indignation upon them:1
Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD:1
shall devour you:1
but rather do them service:1
he shall know of the doctrine:1
and his heart greatly trembled:1
I will also destroy the idols:1
He that smiteth Kirjathsepher:2
she is thy sister:1
Ye mountains:4
And the woman said unto the serpent:1
and continued his speech until midnight:1
and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even:1
and Uzzah and Ahio:1
The people sat down to eat and drink:1
for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased:1
and one messenger to meet another:1
I will surely do thee good:1
And those that were numbered of them:3
but my words shall not pass away:3
my family is poor in Manasseh:1
and set it before them:1
they let them go:3
and behold the height of the stars:1
his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them:1
he took a knife:1
to set forward the workmen in the house of God:1
and it was set on David:1
He will take your sons:1
and bow thine ear to my understanding:1
and over the treasures of the dedicated things:1
ye are brethren:2
And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons:1
so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end:1
the food of the field:1
What way went he:1
And he came to Jerusalem:2
Then said David:6
Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose:1
s sake I will not rest:1
saying unto him:12
that I might gain them that are under the law:1
and the breadth was fifty cubits:1
And when he was come into the house:4
Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot:1
neither have kept my judgments:1
And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me:1
And all the cities of those kings:1
and Shimshai the scribe:3
shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt:1
And when Saul was come to Jerusalem:1
and shall kill him:1
clothed in their robes:1
And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet:1
from the bay that looketh southward:1
and come again to me:1
and they shall be no more two nations:1
and set him by him:1
silver basons of a second sort four hundred and ten:1
Every one of them is gone back:1
And it came to pass at the end of seven days:1
but that it shall be desolate for ever:1
wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved:1
to pluck up:3
and sold a girl for wine:1
by the gate of Bathrabbim:1
and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy:1
and sendeth waters upon the fields:1
and gave it to the disciples:1
even the kings that sit upon David:1
clothed:74
And ye shall serve the LORD your God:1
and make me equal:1
and lift them up for ever:1
and for the axes:1
even so our boasting:1
and I will make them rulers over you:1
and gave it to them:1
as I have been thy father:1
fifty and six:4
So Joshua ascended from Gilgal:1
The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal:1
for he is the LORD:1
the son of Zechariah:5
and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun:1
insomuch that many said:1
making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly:1
of the which I tell you before:1
And the devil:4
And his master said unto him:1
And Saul also went home to Gibeah:1
he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD:1
s garment:44
the Holy Ghost said:1
and turn yourselves from your idols:1
and did turn many away from iniquity:1
ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever:1
that despise my name:1
lions:48
and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee:1
Come thou and all thy house into the ark:1
which he hateth:1
And as they departed from Jericho:1
And they built a city:1
I am with child:1
and the mantles:1
that he may do his work:1
to melt it:1
And in their mouth was found no guile:1
and consenting unto his death:1
and thou shalt rule over him:1
So he built the house:1
Nor to build houses for us to dwell in:1
and told how Peter stood before the gate:1
hereby know we that we are in him:1
shall be broken:21
desiring him that he would not delay to come to them:1
The boar out of the wood doth waste it:1
seeing all the congregation are holy:1
And now:85
but thy commandment is exceeding broad:1
and ten bulls:1
And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee:1
And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king:1
yet ye turned not to me:1
the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin:1
And if the way be too long for thee:1
And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon:1
all that he saith cometh surely to pass:1
Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail:1
let us leave off this usury:1
ye shall leave none of it until the morrow:1
That ye come not among these nations:1
And of Naphtali he said:1
and from the gate of his place:1
for he dwelleth on high:1
and them that worship and that swear by the LORD:1
Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men:1
for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel:1
I have heard that there is corn in Egypt:1
and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD:1
God will establish it for ever:1
which causeth through us thanksgiving to God:1
bare them witness:1
Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way:1
and did not one fashion us in the womb:1
even every good piece:1
while he blessed them:1
and afterward it shall be inhabited:1
which thou shalt have:3
and of the place of the mercy seat:1
and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind:1
His disciples say unto him:2
and Jaasau:1
even I have seen it:1
a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord:1
for Israel had fled every man to his tent:1
because ye have not kept your master:1
The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand:1
and afterwards build thine house:1
your heart shall rejoice:2
and the breadth thereof:8
and elders:17
and shame shall cover her which said unto me:1
And he was sore athirst:1
come out:72
crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud:1
and let him go free:1
And he put them all out:1
This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt:1
And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle:1
but now is made manifest to his saints:1
and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence:1
and ye shall put them upon your sons:1
Avoiding this:1
And it came to pass:352
Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us:1
when they heard that:9
for to day the LORD will appear unto you:1
and of the chief of the fathers of Israel:1
Simon Peter said unto him:1
there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth:4
And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour:1
even because they have seduced my people:1
let them fall by their own counsels:1
and hast given it unto the Levite:1
and sore sicknesses:1
Take from hence thirty men with thee:1
let us:146
as one mourneth for his only son:1
The wise in heart shall be called prudent:1
nor make any cuttings in their flesh:1
which is upon the face of all the earth:1
carry corn for the famine of your houses:1
Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them:1
and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness:1
in any sin that he sinneth:1
And the angel of the LORD went further:1
they rejoiced with exceeding great joy:1
his mercy is everlasting:1
Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called:1
and to my servant:2
to bring out the bones out of the house:1
And the servant ran to meet her:1
and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse:1
let us not fight against God:1
as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon:1
And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons:1
if there be good toward David:1
whereunto the king advanced him:1
and Balaam smote the ass:1
your house is left unto you desolate:2
go to Nineveh:1
and pulled away the shoulder:1
Is not this Joseph:1
for he was before me:2
Let no man leave of it till the morning:1
and behold the wicked abominations that they do here:1
and against his family:1
and in the book of Nathan the prophet:1
and teraphim:2
and Solomon said unto him:1
but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed:1
or for one ram:1
and from a people terrible from their beginning hitherto:1
cease:112
One basket had very good figs:1
and died at even:1
and trouble:12
And they came before the king:1
because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD:1
nor parched corn:1
to ask us a king:1
s chapel:1
that it should not be covered:1
And he said also unto his disciples:1
and his arrogancy:1
In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen:1
of the stock of Israel:1
I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove:1
for had they known it:1
Male and female created he them:1
Within a year:1
and buildest it in three days:2
It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it:1
but if any man draw back:1
Her former husband:1
undertake for me:1
who is he that shall condemn me:1
and the heavens:9
they are far from thy law:1
for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon:1
and could not come at him for the press:1
and sang praises unto God:1
and begat twenty and eight sons:1
neither were thankful:1
And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan:1
went a day:2
saying that these things were so:1
for childhood and youth are vanity:1
But new wine must be put into new bottles:1
and that seek him with the whole heart:1
I will ascend into heaven:1
And the temple of God was opened in heaven:1
shall be destroyed from among the people:1
And their king shall go into captivity:1
And Judah and Israel dwelt safely:1
for the tent of the congregation:1
For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law:1
and against the man that is my fellow:1
see ye not:1
And the LORD appeared unto him:3
that ye should be mine:1
We will willingly give them:1
And she conceived:7
Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress:1
above all the men which were upon the face of the earth:1
that I will gather all nations and tongues:1
but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water:1
Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets:1
These were the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers:1
And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went:2
for he that cometh to God must believe that he is:1
and a time to cast away:1
turn back again:2
hear the word of the Lord GOD:2
And Amaziah strengthened himself:1
as seeing him who is invisible:1
though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient:1
they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel:1
they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ:1
get thee to thine own house:1
then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it:1
and Semachiah:1
Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth:1
the cankerworm:6
But if we walk in the light:1
I am he that liveth:1
For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong:1
O ye travelling companies of Dedanim:1
whether in tents:1
He that made me whole:1
For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come:1
And they shall be coupled together beneath:1
and their faces toward the east:1
their inward part is very wickedness:1
For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity:1
These mentioned by their names were princes in their families:1
but let him glorify God on this behalf:1
And Jesus answering them said:1
being fruitful in every good work:1
now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel:1
When I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit:1
and none shall be alone in his appointed times:1
So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many:1
and made them other five talents:1
nor to drink wine:1
who is blessed for ever:1
when the sun went down:1
They shall not take a wife that is a whore:1
Who ought to have been here before thee:1
And the cherubims lifted up their wings:1
unto Pharaoh king of Egypt:5
and he said to Laban:1
Thus shall ye say unto your master:2
Unto you first God:1
and I will preserve thee:1
and chased out of the world:1
and he shall go forth by the way thereof:1
So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver:1
and shalt be turned into another man:1
Your brethren that hated you:1
and at Dibon:1
but thou shalt be called Hephzibah:1
as of a trumpet:1
that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation:1
in thy mouth:10
The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon:1
Therefore I will wail and howl:1
for themselves are separated with whores:1
also he made unto it a crown of gold round about:1
And he said unto Balak:1
for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven:1
It is my people:1
Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes:1
praise ye him:1
the cities:187
And he did eat and drink:1
hearken:200
He built even Bethlehem:1
their foot shall slide in due time:1
and bake twelve cakes thereof:1
let them return therefore every man to his house in peace:1
be thou the mother of thousands of millions:1
and the dream is certain:1
but that the wicked turn from his way and live:1
they are more righteous than thou:1
Gather ye together:2
so shall your words be verified:1
It is not in heaven:1
and went not down to his house:1
if there be in me iniquity:1
he hath turned me back:1
who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth:1
and the caterpiller:1
Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me:1
even Jesus Christ:1
Mercy and truth preserve the king:1
Your words have been stout against me:1
Know ye Laban the son of Nahor:1
and by the smoke:1
that in simplicity and godly sincerity:1
and Rohgah:1
so is my beloved among the sons:1
And gave their land for an heritage:2
a perfect and an upright man:2
when the LORD thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about:1
because Judas had the bag:1
That thou mayest say to the prisoners:1
and my soul shall live:2
nevertheless I am not ashamed:1
thou hast made my days as an handbreadth:1
Benjamin:166
But Jesus stooped down:1
ye shall be consumed:2
northward four a day:1
and they unto the circumcision:1
and they bare children:2
And Zorah:1
and went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land:1
and upon the persons that were there:1
and waste:9
is unclean:32
What hast thou done unto us:1
Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign:1
ye are God:2
and the LORD hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself:1
that send forth thither the feet of the ox and the ass:1
and wash your feet:2
And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam:1
and we will hear it:1
and while they stand by:1
and shall water the valley of Shittim:1
a bright cloud overshadowed them:1
the eighth to Abijah:1
it shall be an excellent oil:1
but against principalities:1
Then Joshua passed from Makkedah:1
to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God:1
and by liberal things shall he stand:1
where is the receiver:1
but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir:1
And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness:1
And these are the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah:1
Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you:1
even he that abideth of old:1
In the law it is written:1
but we know that:1
even the daughter of my dispersed:1
and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves:1
There was a little city:1
and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar:1
and to turn away thy wrath from them:1
and fell on the ground:1
And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years:1
and a wall on that side:1
From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD:1
and get up:1
Ye have compassed this mountain long enough:1
But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart:1
that they may serve other gods:1
and Michael:2
against David:4
through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us:1
A man shall be commended according to his wisdom:1
above all people that are upon the face of the earth:1
and set in the cities of Samaria:1
And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes:1
Eliphelet:6
if it be truth:1
And David built there an altar unto the LORD:2
and to call peaceably unto them:1
then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him:1
I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar:1
she did it for my burial:1
according as the woman:1
It was meet that we should make merry:1
and bowed his shoulder to bear:1
and Mahalah:1
Jeremiah:145
for therefore I have seen thy face:1
for God is able to graff them in again:1
And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud:1
that I should hope:1
and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly:2
Where is thy Father:1
or to take water withal out of the pit:1
Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour:1
the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas:1
Of the sons of Merari:1
we ought also to love one another:1
and will distress them:1
watching Jesus:1
And the Kohathites set forward:1
the offspring and the issue:1
because ye have not committed this trespass against the LORD:1
and to mourning:1
and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags:1
the silver is with me:1
Thou hast shewed thy people hard things:1
The children of Gazzam:1
s building:5
And Hashubah:1
according to all that he had done to Lachish:1
that dwelt by the river of Chebar:1
preaching the gospel:5
it shall also prove me perverse:1
Thou huntest me as a fierce lion:1
I will extol thee:2
the son of Josiphiah:1
and bring him with thee:1
therefore let them dwell in the land:1
I am rich:2
but could not prevail against it:1
there is none understanding in him:1
And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners:1
and our tongue with singing:1
which belongeth to Zidon:1
For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever:1
And the children of Aram:1
What have I to do any more with idols:1
when thou awakest:2
for she is thy life:1
And he could not answer Abner a word again:1
and went to Damascus:1
As soon as the morning was light:1
we remember that that deceiver said:1
Until thy brother:1
And the men of Israel:10
And I intreat thee also:1
I have prepared seven altars:1
thou wilt hear:5
that he that ploweth should plow in hope:1
they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me:1
Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the officers were:1
to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:1
though I taught them:1
Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity:1
The men of Bethel and Ai:2
the abomination of the children of Ammon:1
saith the Preacher:1
and with the famine:1
seeing I am a great people:1
Belteshazzar answered and said:1
and consecrated one of his sons:1
going and weeping:1
neither moth corrupteth:1
that I should remove it from before my face:1
neither let me see this great fire any more:1
He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel:1
and to bless him:1
And he blessed him:2
and ye shall know that I am the LORD that smiteth:1
from generation to generation shall they dwell therein:1
and to be admired in all them that believe:1
And he returned to Judah:1
and the bread is in a manner common:1
the heaven of heavens:3
neither make mention of the name of their gods:1
I am a dry tree:1
under Ashdothpisgah:2
and ye shall be the children of the Highest:1
but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:1
These men:5
and spirit to them that walk therein:1
to him it is sin:1
Ye shall not surely die:1
and red skins of rams:1
ye sons of Zeruiah:2
all of them fatlings of Bashan:1
and he shall strengthen thine heart:1
and Shenazar:1
In these dwelt the children of Joseph the son of Israel:1
to do a trespass against the LORD:1
and get thee into the land of Judah:1
And again he sent another servant:1
For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth:1
it shall be with tabrets and harps:1
that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner:1
And David longed:2
mine enemies reproach me:1
for the ungodly and for sinners:1
Go ye into the village over against you:1
nor extortioners:1
He rebuked the Red sea also:1
wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord:1
But I must die in this land:1
To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight:1
And they shall dwell safely therein:1
as he was wont:2
and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood:1
Or who hath first given to him:1
and was lame on both his feet:1
And Herod with his men of war set him at nought:1
and go up into the mountain:1
of Moab:99
Aaron and Moses:5
and they came as grasshoppers for multitude:1
And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey:1
For the people were numbered:1
and they fed in a meadow:2
Which things also we speak:1
So after he had washed their feet:1
even so had they done it:1
and hatcheth them not:1
that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity:1
The LORD hath sworn:4
the house of the LORD:184
His ways are always grievous:1
and then shall every man have praise of God:1
And the kingdom and dominion:1
and that which I have seen I will declare:1
They have made it desolate:1
there is one that accuseth you:1
thy sins are forgiven thee:1
nor the inhabitants of Bethanath:1
And Jacob went out from Beersheba:1
seeking goodly pearls:1
When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly:1
that thy days may be prolonged:2
which is the word of God:1
to whom vengeance belongeth:2
and told him all that Saul had done to him:1
that:12230
The tabernacle of the congregation:1
from among their people:3
They all hold swords:1
afterward I rose up:1
A whip for the horse:1
they shall go in thither:1
which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness:1
As the valleys are they spread forth:1
O king of Assyria:1
the children of Rezin:1
Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people:1
ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place:1
For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea:1
and at Mekonah:1
and they make haste to shed innocent blood:1
and touch all that he hath:1
shall surely be the LORD:1
Now therefore make a new cart:1
Now the Philistines fought against Israel:2
Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius:1
and the horses and their riders shall come down:1
My father and my brethren:1
Discern:1
And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men:1
eateth and drinketh damnation to himself:1
and they were created:1
But the tithes of the children of Israel:1
the one by a bondmaid:1
Call his name Mahershalalhashbaz:1
that I may destroy them:1
which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord:1
and the earth was filled with violence:1
s house silver or gold:1
and bare a daughter:1
he was much displeased:1
the altar of gold:2
that the firstborn said unto the younger:1
having charge at the gates of the house:1
skipping upon the hills:1
which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we:1
and their flocks to hot thunderbolts:1
The LORD hath been mindful of us:1
For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time:1
shall be beaten with many stripes:1
of whom shall I be afraid:1
concerning the which I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers:1
that he hath done this:1
and for your children:1
and they shall bear the burden with thee:1
and be gracious unto thee:1
but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat:1
which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel:1
and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty:1
neither executed my judgments:1
O my Father:2
that thou hast brought me hitherto:2
where the LORD commanded:1
which is the year of tithing:1
I will restore:6
and no man with thee:1
in the feasts:2
Samuel also said unto Saul:1
and there is no man that receiveth me to house:1
and instruments of his chariots:1
for they have nothing to eat:1
shew them the form of the house:1
incline thine ear:8
If the men of my tabernacle said not:1
He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings:1
And all Israel shall hear:1
For thou art great:1
and four parts shall be your own:1
and the tree yielding fruit:1
then the children shall tremble from the west:1
And the woman came unto Saul:1
But now is made manifest:1
so that in all your doings your sins do appear:1
the king of Adullam:1
when Elijah heard it:1
speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee:1
When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh:1
and hath brought us forth out of Egypt:1
And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief:1
then let me bear the blame for ever:1
for I will forgive their iniquity:1
and we all are the work of thy hand:1
he shall surely die:3
Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness:1
he shall prevail against his enemies:1
until we come again unto you:1
and the paps which thou hast sucked:1
and shine upon the counsel of the wicked:1
in thee I am well pleased:1
that she shall feign herself to be another woman:1
And he said unto the men of Succoth:1
and to his saints:1
A cubit shall be the length thereof:1
And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets:1
wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD:1
over against the other coupling thereof:2
we cannot find him out:1
being understood by the things that are made:1
and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the LORD:1
have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:1
And David enquired at the LORD:1
whose branches run over the wall:1
I am not of the body:2
see whether it be well with thy brethren:1
and then:37
are written in the story of the prophet Iddo:1
And reigned in mount Hermon:1
both Herod:1
Simon by name:1
whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy:1
give him drink:1
But Elymas the sorcerer:1
but they were not satisfied:1
so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God:1
The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed:1
And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years:1
and mounted up from the earth in my sight:1
And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes:1
every one unto his work:1
This is the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar:1
and of the governors of the country:1
The chief was Ahiezer:1
There is one lawgiver:1
For who knoweth what is good for man in this life:1
neither shall there be any more hail:1
Behold also:2
as much as they can carry:1
Hearest thou what these say:1
and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon:1
O mountains of Israel:1
which he hath planted:1
Then the deputy:1
I will appease him with the present that goeth before me:1
and the reeds they have burned with fire:1
and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken:1
and delivered them unto me:1
to do after all that is written in this book:1
There is none other commandment greater than these:1
for in the wilderness shall waters break out:1
And ye shall chase your enemies:1
that ye sorrowed after a godly sort:1
and let us hear likewise what he saith:1
these lifted up themselves also:1
The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned:1
My people ask counsel at their stocks:1
Draw nigh to God:1
but to the priests the sons of Aaron:1
which spake in thy name to our kings:1
the Chaldeans brake:1
And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years:1
I say therefore to the unmarried and widows:1
Then took they the body of Jesus:1
when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany:1
then the house that was sold:1
which is able to build you up:1
And I will take away his blood out of his mouth:1
a seller of purple:1
s at his coming:1
that ye shall keep this service:1
and of him came the chief ruler:1
and the LORD revengeth:1
the LORD led me to the house of my master:1
and followed Jesus in the way:1
but by the grace of God:1
thou Jordan:1
and when they had seen the brethren:1
Surely the heathen that are about you:1
And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there:1
that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you:1
three:554
and they had no comforter:1
but unto witnesses chosen before God:1
and mine husband is dead:1
that they may be blameless:1
that I be not further tedious unto thee:1
and he would not that any man should know it:1
let him speak as the oracles of God:1
And if:210
whelps:10
who receive the office of the priesthood:1
Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar:1
as at other times:7
and drought:1
but for the worse:1
s garment that he had put on was girded unto him:1
and say unto Absalom:1
and Libya:2
the servant of the LORD:18
And when inquisition was made of the matter:1
but dureth for a while:1
she is the only one of her mother:1
burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt:1
and their life is among the unclean:1
Refrain thy voice from weeping:1
seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth:1
For from the top of the rocks I see him:1
and unto Lebanon:1
excess of wine:1
and Aaron offered them as an offering before the LORD:1
Are not my princes altogether kings:1
because the war was of God:1
as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee:3
Thirty milch camels with their colts:1
I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world:1
according to his promise:2
and take up a wailing for us:1
I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul:1
It is false:1
come down from thy glory:1
he will prosper us:1
who maketh the clouds his chariot:1
s womb was carried:1
thither they return again:1
and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:1
Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD:1
whose name alone is JEHOVAH:1
which drinketh iniquity like water:1
he is their strength in the time of trouble:1
which neither can see:1
and of the Holy Ghost:2
and turn again to the LORD:1
carried about of winds:1
so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine:1
for he is thy Lord:1
Nor consider that it is expedient for us:1
for the offerings:2
Either his uncle:1
because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel:1
Christ is preached:1
and the name of Nahor:1
why should he take away thy bed from under thee:1
and be your protection:1
and Abinadab the second:1
and thy people that enter in by these gates:1
out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire:1
Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor:1
He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him:1
and Jaazer:1
there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:1
Woe unto them that call evil good:1
And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month:1
for the part of the children of Judah was too much for them:1
s chamberlains:5
But with whom was he grieved forty years:1
through whom they come:1
In that day shall he swear:1
And he was numbered with the transgressors:1
and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain:1
but thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy neighbour:1
And call Jesse to the sacrifice:1
their prayer and their supplications:1
I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone:1
and for all that are in authority:1
unto whom the word of God came:1
And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever:1
until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in:1
Hast thou killed:1
but they had no comforter:1
And the high priest stood up in the midst:1
saith the LORD:589
And all their villages that were round about the same cities:1
but understanding what the will of the Lord is:1
And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten:1
And in the third chariot white horses:1
my soul hath not been polluted:1
But the same servant went out:1
then the ear:1
which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go:1
and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law:1
Remember that I stood before thee to speak good for them:1
and scatter the cummin:1
And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river of Egypt:1
but smote upon his breast:1
and I will enter into the height of his border:1
and ye shall stay no longer:1
and the city which is called by thy name:1
And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne:1
I will make thee ruler over many things:2
And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food:1
Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess:1
And of the children of Israel:2
So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day:1
and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth:1
and Azariah begat Johanan:1
Concerning Edom:1
and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps:1
But neither so did their witness agree together:1
So shall it be at the end of the world:1
And I took unto me two staves:1
Shall I not visit them for these things:1
and let me not be ashamed of my hope:1
and all that do unrighteously:1
them will the LORD bring upon thee:1
God do so to thee:1
The same dealt subtilly with our kindred:1
the father of the valley of Charashim:1
till he have set judgment in the earth:1
It is neither fit for the land:1
and Tophel:1
every one over against his house:1
choke the word:2
Art thou an Ephraimite:1
which are neither robbers of churches:1
Hath not my hand made all these things:1
The king desireth not any dowry:1
This is done because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt:1
And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds:1
and I shall behold his righteousness:1
the sea and the waves roaring:1
which was given him in mount Ephraim:1
save Jesus only:2
And he brought the people:1
But the Philistines took him:1
and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made:1
And they found an Egyptian in the field:1
Thou sayest:6
And the name of the star is called Wormwood:1
and to men:1
and there was no more sea:1
And thou shalt make ouches of gold:1
and the captain of the children of Simeon shall be Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai:1
And they took two princes of the Midianites:1
and upon my vesture did they cast lots:1
jewels of silver:4
But when Herod:3
and the stronger Jacob:1
what wait I for:1
and I will make the rivers islands:1
Let no man seek his own:1
when he shall come and pray toward this house:1
If the world hate you:1
if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time:1
For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it:1
And Obal:1
the babe leaped in her womb:1
and the vine of Sibmah:1
and created man upon it:1
which bare him Hur:1
for there were many:3
And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho:1
But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ:1
to be a reproach and a proverb:1
and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him:1
then the priest shall shut him up seven days:3
one of the king:9
he stumbleth:3
and to be drunken:1
And this shall be a sign unto thee:3
with the gate Shallecheth:1
From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah:1
Who can count the dust of Jacob:1
Art thou a master of Israel:1
Ye have not gone up into the gaps:1
his greatness:5
that they destroyed utterly:1
Wherefore I also said:1
and his roots from beneath:1
for sinners also love those that love them:1
that Absalom said unto the king:1
Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah:1
Defraud not:1
of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods:1
Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month:1
and gather us from among the heathen:1
and sent forth the dove:1
from Hebron:2
The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps:1
I will go up:5
and come out to me:1
Beno:3
and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth:1
but to the counsellors of peace is joy:1
If thou seest the oppression of the poor:1
or peace offerings unto the LORD:2
Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me:1
Be not afraid because of them:1
and held a council against him:1
And when they bring you unto the synagogues:1
and to this house:1
and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life:1
and forgat me:1
and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate:1
and the maids in the cities of Judah:1
Then they came to Zerubbabel:1
and fire to give light in the night:1
with the musical instruments of David the man of God:1
And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat:1
At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD:1
all of them in the land:1
his disciples came unto him:3
and choose out my words to reason with him:1
did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also:1
their faces shall be as flames:1
give:1530
and understandeth it:2
which are many:1
then of all the apostles:1
and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed:1
we will pass over to Gibeah:1
and a great and strong wind rent the mountains:1
which delighted in thee:2
I have not seen him:1
and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive:1
Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest:1
or thy son:8
And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea:1
having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem:1
And she said:46
Lest he tear my soul like a lion:1
And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven:1
we had been as Sodoma:1
Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD:1
Tell ye:4
nor the pillar of fire by night:1
of the sons of Shubael:1
And if he will not redeem the field:1
and there is no judgment in their goings:1
and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man:1
for he was but a youth:1
foaming out their own shame:1
and baptized:2
but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils:1
to destroy it:13
and cut off the Anakims from the mountains:1
and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him:1
and thy years unto the cruel:1
and smote the Edomites which compassed him in:1
And unto his son will I give one tribe:1
And Cabbon:1
to you is the word of this salvation sent:1
But Philip was found at Azotus:1
with all the remnant of the people:1
And the LORD said unto Joshua:8
and Rimmon:1
and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot:1
That the aged men be sober:1
ye children of Israel:4
And they laid it up till the morning:1
as wax melteth before the fire:1
and saw:53
that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei:1
And all that Samuel the seer:1
and the arms of the south shall not withstand:1
he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword:1
for his life is taken from the earth:1
therefore take heed to your spirit:1
to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem:1
old men:13
that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even:1
And Huzzab shall be led away captive:1
And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt:1
therefore he said to his chariot man:1
and thine infamy turn not away:1
A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me:1
that I may bury my dead out of my sight:1
Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God:1
Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here:1
but ye have forsaken him:1
yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not:1
God is not in all his thoughts:1
and are given in marriage:1
If I bear witness of myself:1
if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath:1
in my prayer:5
shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it:1
the redemption of our body:1
and their tongue a sharp sword:1
For these things I weep:1
I have said to corruption:1
that we may eat:4
and spices:3
And when he was come into his own country:1
The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel:1
He shall surely be put to death:1
let my supplication:1
Shashai:1
and reacheth to Carmel westward:1
Alian:1
for our end is come:1
neither enter therein:1
when Joab observed the city:1
And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom:1
when they went out of the camp:1
shall bring mine offering:1
and the carbuncle:1
Hide thy face from my sins:1
Thou shalt not eat it:2
Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem:2
as the LORD had spoken unto Moses:1
Then the disciples:5
and in you all:1
for a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD:1
because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah:1
And David saith:1
blessed are they that hear the word of God:1
and between thy seed and her seed:1
And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus:1
and he called his name Er:1
I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ:1
and possessed the city of palm trees:1
Balaam the son of Beor hath said:2
at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away:1
and he drank of the brook:1
and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them:1
Keep silence:2
but also to be forward a year ago:1
as ye have said:2
and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel:1
neither marry:3
which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them:1
and the burnt offering of the people:1
Said with a loud voice:1
And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Halohesh:1
is accepted with him:1
Nadab:20
which had given such power unto men:1
they grow:4
for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us:1
and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day:1
and shall eat your flesh as it were fire:1
And yet they would not hearken unto their judges:1
and bear a son:4
and he shall not be able to hide himself:1
but he said unto me:1
cannot be my disciple:3
and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness:1
and of beast:7
which they of old time have set in thine inheritance:1
Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah:1
they brought him into holds:1
And the sons of Shemidah were:1
For I am the LORD:5
I will not conceal his parts:1
and his land:6
Remember me:4
ye high hills:1
then shall I be upright:1
and went their ways:2
Gird up now thy loins like a man:1
which dwelleth in mount Zion:1
when he came down from the mount:1
which desire to walk in long robes:1
and wonders in the land of Ham:1
For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven:1
And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath:1
and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh:1
I fast twice in the week:1
he was there alone:1
yet will I not hear them:1
let us take their daughters to us for wives:1
and doeth them not:1
and refused to walk in his law:1
And thou shalt give the money:1
thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets:1
a man of Issachar:1
having seven horns and seven eyes:1
and threescore and seven priests:1
and Abednego:14
Balak:43
seeing he giveth to all life:1
and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water:1
that thou shalt go out with me to battle:1
So Jehoshabeath:1
were there with the ark of the covenant of God:1
Therefore I will look unto the LORD:1
and he is become my salvation:1
so the land became Pharaoh:1
s house free in Israel:1
If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me:1
and Jesus went before them:1
as it were before a sword:1
even holy convocations:1
where the ark of God was:1
But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise:1
But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel:1
These are the generations of Shem:1
behold:724
and two months at home:1
and I will go with you:1
to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities:1
I have surnamed thee:1
for he seeth that his day is coming:1
And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter:1
Grace unto you:2
For if the inheritance be of the law:1
I have seen the wicked in great power:1
salute you:9
And the sons of Neariah:1
and Henoch:1
except God be with him:1
And when the Lord saw her:1
Let them be confounded that persecute me:1
and gathered themselves together:1
neither will they be persuaded:1
for their folly shall be manifest unto all men:1
and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu:1
and Gaba:3
and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations:1
was thirty and eight thousand:1
and to death:1
his dominion shall be a great dominion:1
they are quenched as tow:1
And if thy right eye offend thee:1
The LORD will destroy the house of the proud:1
with storm and tempest:1
he will give them that are wicked to the sword:1
neither shall any son of man dwell therein:1
that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay:1
and the belly for meats:1
Art not thou also one of this man:1
Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem:1
because he hath glorified thee:1
I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies:1
are ye now made perfect by the flesh:1
I said not unto the seed of Jacob:1
Be of good cheer:3
priests:379
nor abusers of themselves with mankind:1
We will not walk therein:1
and considered it well:1
neither any tree:1
but I will correct thee in measure:1
and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns:1
And one of the elders saith unto me:1
that favour my righteous cause:1
and of the womb:1
And when she had brought them unto him to eat:1
and the people shall be gathered against them:1
but as of one:1
And I will set my face against you:1
Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin:1
Then we turned:2
When ye have lifted up the Son of man:1
as of things that are made:1
but he shall stumble and fall:1
Thou lovest all devouring words:1
For he spake:2
seek peace:3
are mine:12
Wherefore am I come from Geshur:1
but tattlers also and busybodies:1
and he described unto him the princes of Succoth:1
and praise thy name for ever:1
And beside this:1
so she provoked her:1
and hardened his heart:2
they returned again to Lystra:1
And he commanded the foremost:1
Surely the darkness shall cover me:1
and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him:1
But let patience have her perfect work:1
but pursue after your enemies:1
men of Macedonia:1
to speak unto him for Adonijah:1
for it is a people of no understanding:1
and the house that he had built:2
Make thee bonds and yokes:1
he was exceeding glad:1
neither turned they from their wicked works:1
and whom ye have desired:1
and pitched in Zalmonah:1
when the number of his months is cut off in the midst:1
it shall not return unto me void:1
and to the Gadites:3
neither by prophets:1
and to Dibon:1
He holdeth back the face of his throne:1
Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar:1
and a target of brass between his shoulders:1
and buy us a little food:1
and to save the souls alive that should not live:1
The mouth of strange women is a deep pit:1
This is wickedness:1
and so ye believed:1
And they laid their hands on him:1
only unto these men do nothing:1
and my soul shall abhor you:1
according to all that he hath done shall ye do:1
and thou shalt lend unto many nations:2
Will he force the queen also before me in the house:1
and have overcome them:1
even according to thy fear:1
I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD:1
and plead my cause against an ungodly nation:1
which shall proceed out of thy bowels:1
and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe:1
and selleth him:1
If thou wilt be perfect:1
The king answered and said to Daniel:1
for the woman which thou hast taken:1
and their words to the end of the world:1
but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief:1
Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD:1
Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces:1
when I have accomplished my fury in them:1
yet hath nothing:1
Of the priests:1
all ye that labour and are heavy laden:1
And I will turn your feasts into mourning:1
But the men marvelled:1
See ye not all these things:1
And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter:1
Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world:1
and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men:1
They are corrupt:2
ye shall not fast as ye do this day:1
and thou hast destroyed cities:1
both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar:1
and gave up the ghost:5
In the morning thou shalt say:1
s disciples and the Jews about purifying:1
but let thy servant rejoice:1
A sound of a cry cometh from Babylon:1
and I will exalt him:1
nor the mighty man escape:1
the Comforter will not come unto you:1
until the words of God shall be fulfilled:1
And when the ship was caught:1
Who smote great nations:1
duke Mibzar:2
whether they be strong or weak:1
And the famine was over all the face of the earth:1
he shall bring it unto the altar:1
ye know that it hated me before it hated you:1
that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her:1
deliver me according to thy word:1
boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus:1
And he cried unto the LORD:2
There is neither Jew nor Greek:1
it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head:1
or at midnight:1
and that thou enquire not after their gods:1
I lie not:3
and toward the south five and twenty thousand in length:1
And of the ten horns that were in his head:1
and the other Pharisees:1
Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above:1
whose names are these:3
and shall kill you:1
and have not asked at my mouth:1
of the mule:1
then he blessed them:1
and Zebulun:5
Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine enemy:1
now the day draweth toward evening:1
He appointed the moon for seasons:1
and the place where thine honour dwelleth:1
And I will make Jerusalem heaps:1
the family of the Machirites:1
But woe to them that are with child:1
and get to land:1
I am afraid of you:1
And Boaz said unto the elders:1
and doors for the court:1
to lay the land desolate:1
be of good cheer:4
yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice:1
them will I bring in:1
and slaughter:2
for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied:1
Strangers shall submit themselves unto me:1
and king Asa sent them to Benhadad:1
with righteousness shall he judge the world:1
and they shall till it:1
he thought her to be an harlot:1
And their children:2
that whatsoever thing the LORD shall answer you:1
and shall strike off the heifer:1
all nations shall call him blessed:1
And these things give in charge:1
and my judgment is just:1
And they went:35
cast him down:6
And all flesh died that moved upon the earth:1
but he was asleep:1
sweet to the soul:2
We have no part in David:1
as a stone into the mighty waters:1
that I will break the bow of Israel:1
Let our lord now command thy servants:1
And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder:1
and his nails of brass:1
the family of the house of Nathan apart:1
the dead are raised up:1
our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace:1
and in the fifth month:1
which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone:1
and shall I tell it thee:1
for whom I have suffered the loss of all things:1
and the Holy One of Israel hath created it:1
Elizaphan the son of Parnach:1
and he made them a feast:1
and all their vessels:1
thus she was reproved:1
if thou turn to the LORD thy God:1
that we:732
And he was afraid:1
strife and reproach shall cease:1
I speak it not after the Lord:1
and it fell upon the young men:1
which neither thy fathers:1
and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob:1
that touching any of the priests and Levites:1
judgment:418
and the ancient:1
Thy shoes shall be iron and brass:1
she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor:1
and that thy lips may keep knowledge:1
And again he sent a third:1
till the seed should come to whom the promise was made:1
we cannot be satisfied:1
and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod before it:1
And the sons of Ephraim:1
and sounded with trumpets:1
even so shall ye make it:1
How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay:1
he knoweth:27
both of them have committed an abomination:1
three hundred twenty and eight:1
And he made two cherubims of gold:1
And they shall mock him:1
because of the circumcision:1
which the LORD overthrew in his anger:1
So Haman came in:1
neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes:1
As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard:1
and shalt speak out of the ground:1
That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet:1
but perceive not:1
And as they thus spake:1
I will take no bullock out of thy house:1
and destroy all their molten images:1
ye:6753
and the sea ceased from her raging:1
and offer his burnt offering:1
Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet:1
as in the days of the solemn feast:1
as in the days of old:4
upon the blood of the trespass offering:1
And Simon he surnamed Peter:1
neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth:1
and did likewise:1
and our confusion covereth us:1
that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death:1
and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north:1
and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon:1
he hath delivered them to the slaughter:1
For we are saved by hope:1
and they shall speak lies at one table:1
and left the sheep with a keeper:1
not in thine anger:2
and would not hear:3
that old serpent:2
and my prayer came in unto thee:1
or in their hands:1
And Josiah gave to the people:1
from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon:1
So the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God from that day and forward:1
and in the garden a new sepulchre:1
But Hannah went not up:1
and for an homer of barley:1
S people were prophets:1
And the chief of all the people:1
nor ear heard:1
for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother:1
some sixty:4
the king himself is served by the field:1
and I will give you the land of Israel:1
and Shua their sister:1
and their post by my posts:1
So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah:1
The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon:1
two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough:1
as white as snow:4
thou hast been faithful over a few things:2
so many kinds of voices in the world:1
and marble stones in abundance:1
as he is in the light:1
and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me:1
thou hast known my soul in adversities:1
My friends scorn me:1
how should we then live:1
and to tread them down like the mire of the streets:1
and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus:1
and he loved her:1
Your kerchiefs also will I tear:1
all the sighing thereof have I made to cease:1
being in her father:1
obey my voice according to that which I command thee:1
The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer:1
The sons of Benjamin after their families:1
Ye shall not see me:2
and it displeased him that there was no judgment:1
Where is their God:2
Abraham saith unto him:1
Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord:1
be upon us:4
neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations:1
and a cruse of honey:1
And Peter remembered the word of the Lord:1
as fleeing from a sword:1
And as for Ishmael:1
wherefore he slew him also:1
that lieth before Shechem:1
and Moses talked with them:1
whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us:1
he departed into Galilee:1
and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave:1
I say unto thee:20
tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day:1
In thee shall all nations be blessed:1
and he that hateth suretiship is sure:1
Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing:1
For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past:1
for there is no difference:1
Art thou in health:1
and they shall drink:3
And the Syrians fled before Israel:1
I will surely assemble:1
But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold:1
And David put his hand in his bag:1
he cried:29
and strawed it upon the water:1
Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas:1
which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel:1
Alas for the day:1
and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD:1
and a threefold cord is not quickly broken:1
Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness:1
and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed:1
Pray now unto the LORD our God for us:1
the same shall judge him in the last day:1
set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt:1
And David built round about from Millo and inward:1
And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel:1
every man armed to battle:1
and make them afraid with thy storm:1
and divide it among yourselves:1
They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets:1
likewise to the small rain:1
which thing I hate:1
and put them not unto Laban:1
will he for a fish give him a serpent:1
which they bring unto the LORD:1
when it cometh:3
and many hearing him were astonished:1
that he might deliver him into thy hand:1
and went on eating:1
Therefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts:1
which I have not commanded him to speak:1
Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed:1
which is not of thy seed:1
I am in derision daily:1
and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom:1
and hewed stones:1
in the truth of thy salvation:1
And Zorobabel begat Abiud:1
in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people:1
We have heard with our ears:1
and said unto the nobles:1
and put to confusion:1
And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean:1
as a rotten thing:1
that the king of the children of Ammon died:1
and said unto Mary his mother:1
With our tongue will we prevail:1
and she bare him Segub:1
their wives:25
till every one submit himself with pieces of silver:1
and took up that whereon he lay:1
and ye are gone away:1
and dress them:1
The glory is departed from Israel:2
And some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work:1
and delighted themselves in thy great goodness:1
Yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive:1
Nicodemus saith unto him:1
and get thee into the land of Moriah:1
because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD:1
and will set them to ear his ground:1
for they are without fault before the throne of God:1
And there were three sons of Zeruiah there:1
and The three taverns:1
which he commanded you to perform:1
s wrath is as the roaring of a lion:1
for I am with you:2
neither shall it be for thine honour from the LORD God:1
and went a whoring after Baalim:1
I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance:1
And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth:1
all these have I observed from my youth:1
even that they may bring them unto the LORD:1
in goodly apparel:1
therefore they were in one reckoning:1
and also the Amorites:1
Grudge not one against another:1
leave not thy place:1
for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon:1
and to please them well in all things:1
even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims:1
and the wine:10
when they saw it:2
which will not hear that prophet:1
which thou hast made for thee to dwell in:1
thou committest whoredom:1
For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me:1
Thou hypocrite:3
and for durable clothing:1
and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings:1
thou knowest all things:2
and many of the Corinthians hearing believed:1
and of the consecrations:1
Now therefore come thou:1
who quickeneth all things:1
Sing praises to God:1
and of the covenant which God made with our fathers:1
All thy commandments are faithful:1
and from a deceitful tongue:1
why wentest thou not with thy friend:1
and they cry at all unto me:1
Hear ye:21
Therefore said his parents:1
And by the border of Gad:1
the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob:1
The will of the Lord be done:1
I lead in the way of righteousness:1
Let that therefore abide in you:1
that good may come:1
he went down to Antioch:1
unto Lakum:1
And in the evening he cometh with the twelve:1
which have been done in you:1
how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him:1
because that Elisabeth was barren:1
and let my cry come unto thee:1
why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews:1
And Hananiah:2
Call me Bathsheba:1
From thence she seeketh the prey:1
or in drink:1
s daughter loved him:1
of him shall the Son of man be ashamed:1
And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns:1
and shall add the fifth part thereto:1
but my face shall not be seen:1
And Nabal answered David:1
Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness:1
when none pursueth:3
he shall not come within the camp:1
he dwelleth as a lion:1
and it was accounted to him for righteousness:1
He answered and said:11
or whom have I defrauded:1
and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils:1
and the prophets shall wonder:1
and shall desire to die:1
and deliver us from the heathen:1
As long as I am in the world:1
and Mahanaim with her suburbs:2
I will hear what God the LORD will speak:1
and let him not see my face:1
And Paul said:2
For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua:1
did not I serve with thee for Rachel:1
four hundred and twenty talents:1
and laid upon the mouth of the den:1
and I have not sinned against thee:1
The earth shall quake before them:1
but in mine infirmities:1
or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing:1
and their faces shall look one to another:1
by their generations:14
but also for the sins of the whole world:1
But after that faith is come:1
for they shall all know me:1
So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet:1
a just ephah:2
but of the ship:1
Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite:1
because the famine prevailed over them:1
My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth:1
peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence:1
I did mourn as a dove:1
and they shall be unto you as born in the country among the children of Israel:1
and to them which were in Jattir:1
and the wicked shall not be:1
and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils:1
for the ephod:2
He was a widow:1
And two other rings of gold thou shalt make:1
And Moses did as the LORD commanded him:2
that are within thy gates:1
and three tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering:1
There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth:1
And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense:1
and to them that keep his commandments:1
a man stood before me in bright clothing:1
I shall not be a fool:1
But into whatsoever city ye enter:1
So he let him go:1
The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad:1
He hath bent his bow like an enemy:1
and smote the four corners of the house:1
I have put my trust in the Lord GOD:1
and the rest of the children of the captivity:1
And verily they that are of the sons of Levi:1
Search me:1
and provoke me:2
I saw thee:2
saying unto the people:1
then it is no more grace:1
knowing what was done in her:1
I decked thee also with ornaments:1
I pray thee therefore:1
How many loaves have ye:3
And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long:1
and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon:1
and that divine lies:1
And thou shalt make for it a grate of network of brass:1
and set thereon palm trees and chains:1
And she took flour:1
Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name:1
My house is the house of prayer:1
For how great is his goodness:1
that ye love one another:2
But Festus answered:1
and mourning as the owls:1
So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD:1
and upon all their pools of water:1
for I have not done them of mine own mind:1
Then came the Jews round about him:1
And they kept it close:1
and two cubits was the height of it:1
before there reigned any king over the children of Israel:1
what every man should take:1
Then I saw:3
and buried him in his house at Ramah:1
and was full of heaviness:1
even for Egypt:1
before his works of old:1
s substance:14
and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight:1
He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous:1
when they stood:2
But the other said:1
He is thy praise:1
and all the men of war:3
But ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD for a sweet savour:1
that it was an error:1
by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong:1
Flee also youthful lusts:1
And his disciples say unto him:1
be thou my helper:1
and pierce it:1
the vessels are holy also:1
Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace:1
s heart was hardened:2
then afterward ye shall return:1
The moon and stars to rule by night:1
and the mother with the children:1
and tribulation:2
And he brought up Hadassah:1
land many days:1
and folds for sheep:1
s heart is hardened:1
to observe the sabbath throughout their generations:1
therefore will I also diminish thee:1
and such as breathe out cruelty:1
and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God:1
which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt:1
if ye will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God:1
then thy brother should seem vile unto thee:1
And he said:403
for your land shall not yield her increase:1
This shall be the punishment of Egypt:1
together with her bones:1
and of thy stretched out arm:1
and the LORD shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth:1
s offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation:1
but he that is called of God:1
and she brought him unto Pharaoh:1
For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man:1
moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah:1
singing with loud instruments unto the LORD:1
that in what tribe the stranger sojourneth:1
And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel:1
Then said the Jews unto him:2
who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ:1
thy faith hath saved thee:1
Who hath ascended up into heaven:1
neither will the Almighty regard it:1
Then let my wife grind unto another:1
An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds:1
How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand:1
and they say:6
And four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari:1
and Chub:1
then it was well with him:2
Take ye him:2
that ye may keep your own tradition:1
If I be not an apostle unto others:1
and lodged in the camp:1
say unto her:3
whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort:1
and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt:1
for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death:1
and goeth out into the draught:1
that they may be to you for a memorial before your God:1
which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt:3
whereunto the ark of the LORD hath come:1
And they set them up Micah:1
He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings:1
Zebah and Zalmunna:11
and the bodies of his sons:2
And the other woman said:1
because he is your brother:1
we make him a liar:1
that they may learn not to blaspheme:1
And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain:1
So I awoke:1
the dragons and the owls:1
and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father:2
and wrapped it in linen:1
And the barrel of meal wasted not:1
But thou art holy:1
beside women and children:2
they comfort in vain:1
and their prophets:2
For while one saith:1
From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old shalt thou number them:1
and have light:1
and what is his son:1
Again he said unto her:1
and the whirlwind shall scatter them:1
We will be as the heathen:1
So Joseph died:1
Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur:5
Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites:1
to take possession of it:1
For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel:1
that the spear came out behind him:1
O Jerusalem:16
and of our kindred:1
Behold Israel after the flesh:1
because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD:1
A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly:1
Come near to me:1
and to him that sacrificeth not:1
And then if any man shall say to you:1
I am not of this world:1
and in his own house:3
that it move not:1
according to their manner:1
shut up the words:1
and I am persuaded that in thee also:1
And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city:1
And God said to Jonah:1
and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt:1
and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment:1
they walked not in my statutes:2
Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel:1
sweeter than honey to my mouth:1
And the children of Israel gave to the Levites these cities with their suburbs:1
So the king died:1
were cities given out of the half tribe:1
And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel:1
and Manasses begat Amon:1
we might have a strong consolation:1
A false witness shall not be unpunished:2
that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom:1
and walketh in darkness:1
they doubted of them whereunto this would grow:1
All thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the firstripe figs:1
and trode the grapes:1
Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God:1
s commissions unto the king:1
which was the son of Semei:1
but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness:1
Rise up and walk:1
and spake kindly unto the damsel:1
that Isaac:3
deal thus with them in the time of thine anger:1
by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things:1
and pitched in Marah:1
and my life is preserved:1
they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child:1
They that fear thee will be glad when they see me:1
as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD:1
was two hundred fourscore and eight:1
every man:271
as ye see the day approaching:1
and desperately wicked:1
and for a memorial between thine eyes:1
But murmured in their tents:1
Let thine eyes look right on:1
which thou filledst not:1
insomuch that we despaired even of life:1
and the God of Nahor:1
thou shalt not add thereto:1
Be not wise in thine own eyes:1
the blood of it is for the life thereof:1
And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council:1
if a man speak:1
even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you:1
every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished:1
until he have destroyed thee:2
the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all:1
For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof:1
and pass through:1
Son of man:149
When those went:1
and went out from before Pharaoh:1
And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God:1
for we are all partakers of that one bread:1
And he took the seven loaves and the fishes:1
who is even at the right hand of God:1
We who are Jews by nature:1
the law is no more:1
but the wrath of God abideth on him:1
neither will I have pity:4
much more the wicked and the sinner:1
when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:1
remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things:1
open unto us:2
And the foundation was of costly stones:1
and changeth not:1
Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause:1
Let my heart be sound in thy statutes:1
that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled:1
Have not I commanded thee:1
For when God made promise to Abraham:1
And it came to pass in an eveningtide:1
for thou art greatly beloved:1
And Sisera gathered together all his chariots:1
Flee as a bird to your mountain:1
And Gideon arose:1
Then he remembered the days of old:1
and had taken his garments:1
that I sat down and wept:1
The other disciples therefore said unto him:1
and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD:1
that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest:1
Teach me to do thy will:1
He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days:1
And God hath both raised up the Lord:1
did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD:1
and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners:1
we are greatly confounded:1
let me alone two months:1
Arise and eat:2
When thy sisters:1
The burden of Babylon:1
and although I have scattered them among the countries:1
that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify themselves against Judah:1
and carried him up into a loft:1
sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation:1
He made darkness his secret place:1
but obey their father:1
and the whole mount quaked greatly:1
For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption:1
If the clouds be full of rain:1
whether it be unto death:1
and with all the understanding:1
Because they ministered unto them before their idols:1
I have planted:2
these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh:1
The holy people:1
s mouth is his destruction:1
but when the wicked rise:1
even their heave offering unto the LORD:1
These are the divisions of the porters among the sons of Kore:1
And Joseph made ready his chariot:1
Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts:1
whom the LORD did choose:1
What hast thou done unto me:1
s father were lost:1
upon their chariots:2
Then David arose:3
They have mouths:2
s weight:6
and thy concubines:1
The diseased have ye not strengthened:1
The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south:1
as they walked:1
thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me:1
which is upon the wood that is on the fire:1
And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits:1
as it had been a great sheet:2
and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh:1
But if they will not obey:1
they have not known them:1
Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations:1
when it was desolate:1
the children of Jedaiah:2
for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel:1
a land wherein no man dwelleth:1
that ye know not from whence he is:1
and of the blood which was upon the altar:1
The land:8
And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits:1
and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors:1
and the hoods:1
then that thief shall die:1
of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man:1
Spikenard and saffron:1
The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire:1
forsake her:1
when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father:1
and I washed:1
it shall be a statute for ever in your generations:1
that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain:1
in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia:1
and another glory of the moon:1
Then Pharaoh:6
And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months:1
which gave us the well:1
When they heard that:1
and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart:1
and with a great crown of gold:1
and full of years:1
Then Jacob said unto his household:1
and drove asunder the nations:1
Of Judah:3
Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar:1
She maketh herself coverings of tapestry:1
and so do:2
thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor:1
and she bare him Attai:1
And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you:1
let him receive it:1
So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning:1
Herein is our love made perfect:1
Which may go out before them:1
And if a man shall take his sister:1
whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is:1
and what have ye to do with me:1
which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom:1
which despise thee round about:1
even the goodliest:1
and they called his name Esau:1
let her also be shorn:1
And Jesus said unto him:12
He hath destroyed me on every side:1
and among the inhabitants of the earth:1
he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might:1
whose father was an Egyptian:1
Saddle me the ass:2
And he took unto him all these:1
after so long a time:1
when a wife goeth aside to another instead of her husband:1
and with him fifty males:1
so that he entered into a ship:1
and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds:1
To hear the groaning of the prisoner:1
in the secret places of the stairs:1
The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst:1
and the days were not expired:1
But the wise answered:1
and all that they have:3
And Abishai said:1
And when it rested:1
they prophesied in Baal:1
and of the household of God:1
and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor:1
His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl:1
ye know that by this craft we have our wealth:1
and light was against light in three ranks:2
and Satan came also among them:2
Of the sons of Shechaniah:2
But speaking the truth in love:1
and give warning:1
where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon:1
And Jesus stood:4
each day for a year:2
besought Pilate that their legs might be broken:1
they were exceedingly amazed:1
and to the unwise:1
and to the beasts of the field to be devoured:1
and came near to break the door:1
for an offering made by fire:4
And Mattithiah:2
and my prayer unto the God of my life:1
for I will turn their mourning into joy:1
and were come to the desert of Sinai:1
thou art exalted far above all gods:1
when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice:1
and purge them as gold and silver:1
And heal the sick that are therein:1
all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise:1
And he could there do no mighty work:1
But shun profane and vain babblings:1
and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law:1
and pass over judgment and the love of God:1
Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering:1
which was the son of Cosam:1
And unto the children of Gershon:1
That our garners may be full:1
And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards:1
They on the rock are they:1
that were found in the midst of the city:1
The brother of Michah was Isshiah:1
s face:109
whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room:1
that is not clean by reason of uncleanness that chanceth him by night:1
cities of Hadarezer:1
lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father:1
and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea:1
Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me:1
And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again:1
Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada:1
Whither goest thou:3
And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father:1
But they presumed to go up unto the hill top:1
because they had defiled their sister:1
his marvellous works among all nations:1
thou and Jeremiah:1
King Darius:1
and thou hast taken them captive:1
and besieged Rabbah:2
Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses:1
and will punish you yet seven times for your sins:1
and entered into the city:2
Because the LORD hated us:1
psaltery and harp:3
And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering unto the LORD:1
when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people:1
and perish:10
By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin:1
now see to thine own house:1
For I know thy rebellion:1
and cut off his right ear:2
And said unto them:15
and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den:1
and their heart shall rejoice as through wine:1
and are not his sisters here with us:1
and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left:1
so as no fuller on earth can white them:1
but Abner was not with David in Hebron:1
in thy land:10
of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes:1
He and his people with him:1
the son of Bani:4
if a man be overtaken in a fault:1
that shalt thou do:1
they shall stone them with stones:1
true and righteous are thy judgments:1
he is God:6
and Joktheel:1
and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth:1
passed on before the king:1
nor thy rich neighbours:1
and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee:1
and the disciple standing by:1
As also in all his epistles:1
and upon the Israel of God:1
and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln:1
and turneth it upside down:1
And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the congregation:1
and the Ethiopians captives:1
and will speak unto him in a dream:1
saith the LORD thy God:1
and hath no light:1
and sacrifice unto the LORD our God:1
but now they have no cloak for their sin:1
whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away:1
according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him:1
And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses:1
the lot:22
and the third part of the moon:1
thy holy temple have they defiled:1
He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David:1
s wrath is heavier than them both:1
What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews:1
So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order:1
and Ishbosheth said to Abner:1
the son of Simon:2
Thou hast covered with anger:1
neither their trees stand up in their height:1
he deceiveth himself:1
Which made heaven:1
the people grew and multiplied in Egypt:1
for ye are strangers and sojourners with me:1
and spake unto the sons of Heth:1
he confirmeth them:1
and justifying the righteous:1
And he called the name of that place Bethel:1
He rained flesh also upon them as dust:1
out of the land of Egypt by great judgments:1
But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink:1
let it be done with speed:1
to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day:1
that the LORD hath truly sent him:1
the Susanchites:1
but David waxed stronger and stronger:1
and ye fools:1
the family of the Shelanites:1
and let us eat:1
by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:4
And he straitly charged him:1
s wealth is his strong city:2
from the time that it was:1
Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour:1
and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers:1
was not yea and nay:2
When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies:1
we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God:1
And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their inheritance:1
which is upon thy loins:1
And the glede:1
Sigh therefore:1
within any of thy gates which the LORD thy God giveth thee:1
as the colour of amber:3
And the children of Israel said unto them:1
in the land of the Canaanites:1
the iron for things of iron:1
For there are no bands in their death:1
lightning:27
and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain:1
and yet he hath opened mine eyes:1
So the children of Joseph:1
and leaveth the sheep:1
so shall thy God rejoice over thee:1
five:333
and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there:1
and he shall come:4
and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles:1
All that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner:1
and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land:1
And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him:1
that they may not see the sun:1
because thou hast striven against the LORD:1
that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name:1
What aileth the people that they weep:1
Abraham gave gifts:1
and I prayed for Aaron also the same time:1
Then the spirit took me up:1
or if he have sold the field to another man:1
s heart fail because of him:1
That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment:1
and to the pool that was made:1
the men of the plain:1
they are for war:1
upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir:1
and when they had taken him:1
even the ancient high places are ours in possession:1
because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass:1
Are all apostles:1
And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim:1
for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand:1
Therefore the princes said unto the king:1
for they left him in great diseases:1
with his head:2
and the priests thereof teach for hire:1
that the LORD might perform his word:1
And if ye do good to them which do good to you:1
the love of the Father is not in him:1
and multiplied exceedingly:1
seal the law among my disciples:1
and cut off his head therewith:1
Go down:3
nor their sons:1
thrust them into the inner prison:1
I come as a thief:1
that they should not dwell in Shechem:1
night and day:12
so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot:1
who hath raised him from the dead:1
the locust after his kind:1
even ten tribes:1
For I have no man likeminded:1
And Dilean:1
how he said:1
and seven for the other chapiter:1
that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way:1
How shall we order the child:1
for I say unto you:3
and stonest them that are sent unto thee:1
the breath of the LORD:1
having begun in the Spirit:1
s presence:18
if I would declare and speak of them:1
and shall afflict Eber:1
and trusted not in his salvation:1
and thine are mine:1
He looketh upon men:1
and the Lord Jesus Christ:11
in the city of our God:2
and saw my work:2
I commune with mine own heart:1
I will make mention of thy righteousness:1
and ascended up on the south side unto Kadeshbarnea:1
I shall be anointed with fresh oil:1
then I will come and help thee:1
and strength:28
and the flower of Lebanon languisheth:1
Shammah the Hararite:1
that soul shall be cut off from my presence:1
I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies:1
because he is his friend:1
And when they had lifted up their eyes:1
Judgments are prepared for scorners:1
and tell John what things ye have seen and heard:1
the family of the Ashbelites:1
and also after that:1
and hath rebelled against his lord:1
even unto my cause:1
that every one of you saith:1
all her persecutors overtook her between the straits:1
Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising:1
And they shall know that I am the LORD their God:1
And he returned back from him:1
TO DELIVER ME:1
thou hast said:24
that I may be restored to you the sooner:1
and oft into the water:1
for Gath one:1
when their wrath was kindled against us:1
but charity edifieth:1
all the land of the Hittites:1
that every one which seeth the Son:1
For all this his anger is not turned away:5
I bear up the pillars of it:1
s business required haste:1
and Naaman:3
rose up early:16
took Joash the son of Ahaziah:1
ruling their children and their own houses well:1
or lamb:1
and mine elect shall inherit it:1
one of his disciples saith unto him:1
and said unto them in his doctrine:1
and thou be found guilty:1
And above were costly stones:1
Paul and Timotheus:1
and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband:1
In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit:1
For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan:1
And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds:1
and I make sackcloth their covering:1
took it:29
Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness:1
when he shall appear:2
how he laid wait for him in the way:1
and your companions the Apharsachites:1
One Lord:1
for two hundred abode behind:1
After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his house:1
And the Chaldeans shall come again:1
and commanded them:4
and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives:1
Because thou shalt forget thy misery:1
upon their rivers:1
and sent to king Jareb:1
to whom be honour and power everlasting:1
they kept his testimonies:1
whether warp or woof:1
Who is the image of the invisible God:1
but in singleness of heart:1
Give me here John Baptist:1
for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves:1
and to know all that thou doest:1
thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them:1
neither do they spin:1
till it came and stood over where the young child was:1
And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down:1
But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side:1
when we come into the land:1
if they abide not still in unbelief:1
And David sent and communed with Abigail:1
they speak a vision of their own heart:1
and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice:1
And some began to spit on him:1
The same day went Jesus out of the house:1
yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor:1
Their quiver is as an open sepulchre:1
and on the same day was the sabbath:1
whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out:1
these cities with their villages:3
and heard a voice saying unto me:1
And the people said unto Saul:2
And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land:1
Is not the LORD in Zion:1
and Ziklag:1
Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us:1
But he spake of the temple of his body:1
And they came to Jericho:1
And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee:1
king David took exceeding much brass:1
in the fifth day of the month:3
And Eliezer had none other sons:1
was twenty thousand and two hundred:1
unleavened bread shall be eaten:1
Nay:37
Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD:1
and married her:1
giving out that himself was some great one:1
and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel:1
Return ye now every man from his evil way:1
And it came to pass after the death of Abraham:1
and their mouth speaketh great swelling words:1
with abominations provoked they him to anger:1
They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them:1
for the pleasant fields:1
my throat is dried:1
that a man shall nourish a young cow:1
for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of:1
and call heaven and earth to record against them:1
Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land:1
the sister of Tahpenes the queen:1
against Moab:1
Let no man deceive you with vain words:1
and spoil them until the morning light:1
To whom hast thou uttered words:1
make me not the reproach of the foolish:1
and refreshed themselves there:1
and onycha:1
and went to Jezreel:1
in Sion:3
And hereby we know that he abideth in us:1
and my princes shall no more oppress my people:1
For God hath concluded them all in unbelief:1
and fine gold as the mire of the streets:1
and likewise Lazarus evil things:1
Jesus Christ the righteous:1
For he knoweth vain men:1
and he had sheep:1
which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat:1
that they might not hear my words:1
there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel:1
Preaching the kingdom of God:1
and they have no rest day nor night:1
And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock:1
and a great destruction:1
the chief of the captains:1
but he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction:1
and brake them:4
and I will take pleasure in it:1
whose surname was Thaddaeus:1
Hazarenan:4
that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar:1
Men shall clap their hands at him:1
Lay not wait:1
And all the doors and posts were square:1
and their blossom shall go up as dust:1
Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother:1
wherewith they minister in the sanctuary:1
The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit:1
we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son:1
That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed:1
and as thou hast forgiven this people:1
was Jehonathan the son of Uzziah:1
and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold:1
to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD:1
for yours is the kingdom of God:1
and they knew her:1
she is thy mother:2
after that ye were come forth out of Egypt:1
And hath given him authority to execute judgment also:1
and all the Gentiles:1
And they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month:1
and break their bottles:1
even to me:4
in them shall he die:1
Who can have compassion on the ignorant:1
the young men from their musick:1
Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause:1
according to the working of his mighty power:1
seasoned with salt:1
either in the warp:5
which had nothing:1
is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices:1
and took thereof:1
and the last shall be first:1
upon the place of the blood of the trespass offering:1
while the land is yet before us:1
But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping:1
According to the number that ye shall prepare:1
And they say unto him:2
that fight against it:1
unto Baal:14
Let us be glad and rejoice:1
Whom think ye that I am:1
Threescore and ten kings:1
So he forbare:1
and running to him saluted him:1
These are the families of Judah according to those that were numbered of them:1
and them which were vexed with unclean spirits:1
Then came his disciples:1
And make me savoury meat:1
One sea:1
Great peace have they which love thy law:1
And thou shalt make fifty taches of brass:1
Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently:1
Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels:1
and laid his hands on him:1
they wounded me:1
and brought the money:1
Take therefore no thought for the morrow:1
and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire:1
and begat twenty and two sons:1
fair as the moon:1
in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan:1
every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry:1
until he see his desire upon his enemies:1
Then she that is mine enemy shall see it:1
wherefore shut thou up the vision:1
they are wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel:1
Then thus came every maiden unto the king:1
This also is vanity and vexation of spirit:1
into their own cities:1
And fear not them which kill the body:1
For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell:1
LORD God:225
and shall make marriages with them:1
I will sing a new song unto thee:1
And he took his staff in his hand:1
And Pilate asked him:3
And they shall spring up as among the grass:1
Then I contended with the nobles of Judah:1
They that sit in the gate speak against me:1
and there abide for ever:1
Therefore thus saith the LORD:28
Judah hath dealt treacherously:1
but they went a whoring after other gods:1
and with the rich in his death:1
and unto him shall the gathering of the people be:1
took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God:1
O save me according to thy mercy:1
just and true are thy ways:1
and yet so they sufficed them not:1
And they answered Jesus:1
unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils:1
and Phallu:1
These are the families of the Zebulunites according to those that were numbered of them:1
and part of clay:2
the same is the companion of a destroyer:1
Him God raised up the third day:1
or things to come:2
here cometh a chariot of men:1
and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt:1
For whoso findeth me findeth life:1
And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes:1
he magnified himself even to the prince of the host:1
and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath:1
precious:71
And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you:1
Then he brought me:5
and came and told unto their lord all that was done:1
Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters:1
whom the king my father brought out of Jewry:1
And devils also came out of many:1
for she had neither father nor mother:1
to them of the captivity:4
at the least such as before knew nothing thereof:1
and all the weight was written at that time:1
to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness:1
For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts:1
And many of the people of the land became Jews:1
He shall not fail nor be discouraged:1
and in the fruit of thy land:1
we cannot speak unto thee bad or good:1
and no wool shall come upon them:1
as ye abound in every thing:1
through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:1
Because of his strength will I wait upon thee:1
Pray not for this people for their good:1
and disperse thee in the countries:1
and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil:1
And the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel:1
And he touched her hand:1
and make mention of me unto Pharaoh:1
When Simon Peter saw it:1
in the presence of the priests and of all the people:1
Israel shall be thy name:2
for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD:1
for them that honour me I will honour:1
but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release:1
for thy servant said:1
of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed:1
that they might understand the scriptures:1
his bars:2
he saith unto them:18
and of the Father:1
being glorified of all:1
because he had heard many things of him:1
the dumb spake:2
the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say:1
Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee:1
which spake unto David:1
flee these things:1
the same shall be great:1
Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD:1
And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee:1
and the house fell upon the lords:1
and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land:1
and pierce them through with his arrows:1
Princes shall come out of Egypt:1
and the cause of his people Israel at all times:1
was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels:1
with the second child that shall stand up in his stead:1
For a multitude of the people:1
and hast shed blood:1
If a thief be found breaking up:1
they shall hear my words:1
to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass:1
When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine:1
I am a Pharisee:1
when thou art passed over:1
And base things of the world:1
and took him out:1
And he said unto them the third time:1
shall be found any more in thee:1
he shall save his soul alive:1
thou son of Jesse:1
and her saints shall shout aloud for joy:1
when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee:1
When he was come:2
remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee:1
and perceiving that he had answered them well:1
to use them despitefully:1
doubting nothing:1
flee thee away into the land of Judah:1
it maketh no matter to me:1
nor in the son of man:1
and satisfy thy soul in drought:1
Who shall see them:1
And Deborah said unto Barak:1
and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered:1
So they drew up Jeremiah with cords:1
and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering:1
and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon:1
The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him:1
Paul purposed in the spirit:1
Forty years long was I grieved with this generation:1
and counteth the cost:1
and to go before him unto the other side:1
And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom:1
and after the fire a still small voice:1
with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand:1
And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother:1
according to the manner of the women:1
They shewed his signs among them:1
The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself:1
which were come again out of captivity:1
I will not be enquired of by you:2
and against all the cities of Judah that were left:1
all of you be subject one to another:1
And Festus said:1
Is it such a fast that I have chosen:1
Look to yourselves:1
then was I in his eyes as one that found favour:1
therefore now make ye a league with us:1
What have I sinned:1
that it should not rend:1
the Ithrites:1
and the plain of the valley of Jericho:1
and Nahshon begat Salmon:1
O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments:1
The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore:2
and fleeth:3
I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons:1
if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God:1
In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory:1
that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines:1
to order it:1
and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped:1
his mother and his brethren stood without:1
I will come by you into Spain:1
an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD:1
I sent unto thee:1
and sent her away:1
till he was strong:1
Arabia:18
The prophet that hath a dream:1
nor save him out of his trouble:1
according to the counsel of the princes and the elders:1
one came and said unto him:1
walking on the sea:3
let these go their way:1
which I give unto the children of Israel:2
and grudge if they be not satisfied:1
and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes:1
he stood by his burnt offering:1
by the word of the LORD:8
and upon all the people that were therein:1
because thou hast not given him warning:1
And when ye shall come into the land:1
And grieve not the holy Spirit of God:1
by sending evil angels among them:1
So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed:1
her captains:1
then the man only that lay with her shall die:1
and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim:1
Hothir:2
neither were instruments of musick brought before him:1
an interpreter:2
And David rose up early in the morning:1
And the woman bare a son:1
which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD:1
and the cities of Judah:1
and ye shall traffick in the land:1
he shall restore sevenfold:1
For thou saidst:1
for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines:1
but in uncircumcision:1
unto the praise of his glory:1
thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldest:1
For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up:1
Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters:1
the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers:1
with all the nations that I have cut off:1
by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:1
and deliver me out of thine hand:1
Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee:1
which shall lie down with him in the dust:1
and the Girgashite:6
to possess the land of the Amorite:1
Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance:1
Understand therefore this day:1
Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth:1
did oppress you:1
till there be no place to bury:1
unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:16
and shall die there:1
or of his brother:1
nor defile himself for his father:1
and I therein do rejoice:1
after their generations:1
Yet forty days:1
these be the families of Reuben:1
his praise endureth for ever:1
Rehum:8
the sons of Shashak:1
I the LORD have said:2
and I will also surely bring thee up again:1
and when he visiteth:1
and hast shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity:1
and offered it for sin:1
with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place:1
And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof:1
where the scribes and the elders were assembled:1
in that:192
For do I now persuade men:1
What seemeth you best I will do:1
for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city:1
For I have said:1
the Levites shall set it up:1
s offering:74
for harm:1
There is no king saved by the multitude of an host:1
What I do thou knowest not now:1
And they took Lot:1
Shouldest thou help the ungodly:1
If there be among you any man:1
But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king:1
and fell in one day three and twenty thousand:1
Now therefore put away:1
If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious:1
Solomon my son:6
who have purposed to overthrow my goings:1
and after will I send for many hunters:1
on every high hill:5
for his molten image is falsehood:2
O that they were wise:1
they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ:1
yet for his oath:1
and men loved darkness rather than light:1
Adonijah shall be put to death this day:1
Naarai the son of Ezbai:1
My presence shall go with thee:1
marvellous things without number:1
as in a strange country:1
and mine age is as nothing before thee:1
he is a buckler to all those that trust in him:1
for they know not what they do:1
and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves:1
my spirit faileth:1
bring him:36
and not live:1
He shall therefore burn that garment:1
Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly:1
and rewardeth transgressors:1
for we are exceedingly filled with contempt:1
and put them in the four corners thereof:1
and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord:1
I have received commandment to bless:1
Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not:1
And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons:1
He hath swallowed down riches:1
and his sickness was so sore:1
but leaves only:1
and it abideth:1
He disappointeth the devices of the crafty:1
for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness:1
for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun:1
and with his skirt do touch bread:1
And the earth was without form:1
the judges:21
And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side:1
but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption:1
and for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof:1
and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee:1
that he might perform his saying:1
full of wisdom:1
doth comfort himself:1
to carry us forth out of Egypt:1
And Jeuz:1
And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things unto the LORD:1
which I commanded thee to hide there:1
set thine heart toward the highway:1
for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans:1
unto us a son is given:1
and fall upon him:2
the lofty city:1
s word shall be his burden:1
and over against the building:1
that they rose early about the dawning of the day:1
and shall conceive seed:1
is Christ:19
and they that are otherwise cannot be hid:1
And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD:1
I will pour out my spirit unto you:1
And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him:1
that no man take thy crown:1
one of my brethren:1
thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing:1
And all the villages that were round about these cities to Baalathbeer:1
which he hath made crooked:1
s anger was kindled because he went:1
And he came to the sheepcotes by the way:1
and encamped at Moseroth:1
so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem:1
and cometh to Simon Peter:1
was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither:1
and when thou dost overtake them:1
For he hath said:1
some mocked:1
and let him curse:1
Where are the gods of Hamath and Arphad:1
and that which was written was upright:1
on exhortation:1
that I might destroy them that hate me:2
but I knew not what it was:1
whereof were made vessels for the house of the LORD:1
and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us:1
they shall come with speed swiftly:1
even the princes offered their offering before the altar:1
as at this day:10
all the vessels thereof made he of brass:1
and they go a whoring after their gods:1
all of brass:1
and sat before him:1
who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able:1
therefore enjoy pleasure:1
for we are left but a few of many:1
and rolled the stone from the well:1
The LORD judge between me and thee:1
which was of Gallim:1
and gat him up into the mount:1
and they shall take down the covering vail:1
Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites:1
Which rejoice exceedingly:1
they mourned:6
And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim:1
and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:1
Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab:1
as a seal upon thine arm:1
for he is strong that executeth his word:1
and of sweet cinnamon half so much:1
the nations are as a drop of a bucket:1
and ten of their brethren with them:1
and what have I offended thee:1
why then did ye despise us:1
to enquire of his welfare:1
In him was life:1
even to the soul:1
and I will receive you:1
then shall he that smote him be quit:1
And Rachel died:1
and grieve him in the desert:1
and the crown royal which is set upon his head:1
Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread:1
for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me:1
the voice of thy brother:1
bid to the marriage:1
thine enemies make a tumult:1
And also that every man should eat and drink:1
there shalt thou be delivered:1
Now the LORD hath brought it:1
and the ears of them that hear shall hearken:1
At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon:1
and David heard of it:1
and to few thou shalt give the less inheritance:1
John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance:1
And they have rewarded me evil for good:1
And he was withdrawn from them about a stone:1
do good to them which hate you:1
to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men:1
and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war:1
for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them:1
Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite:1
So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city:1
and to the valleys:3
when:2454
and the street of the city was pure gold:1
and they twain shall be one flesh:1
so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee:1
the work of mine hands:1
and when he shall tread in our palaces:1
As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof:1
For a great door and effectual is opened unto me:1
of a Jew his brother:1
where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left:1
he was the doer of it:1
for our good always:1
we live:7
wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king:1
And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings:1
Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand:1
he was very sorrowful:2
God hath delivered me to the ungodly:1
they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword:1
and set up the vail of the covering:1
and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water:1
if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you:1
and their transgressions that they have exceeded:1
Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah:1
neither acceptest thou the person of any:1
But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon:1
It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes:1
Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries:1
the son of Aaron:13
and of the other:4
And I was afraid:1
And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove:1
Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes:1
I send an Angel before thee:1
And when the governor had read the letter:1
And the heavens shall praise thy wonders:1
I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest:1
And the LORD said unto Aaron:1
and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth:1
and the child grew:1
when thy lips speak right things:1
for all the earth is mine:1
But they said:5
and lead captive silly women laden with sins:1
and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of Assyria:1
And he took their king:1
which is the glory of all lands:2
wholly a right seed:1
Epaphras:3
and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room:1
and go out before us:1
and saith unto Jesus:1
after their nations:1
and open the door:1
let the people tremble:1
and have compassion upon thee:2
And he called unto him the twelve:1
his ways are everlasting:1
Then Daniel answered and said before the king:1
Being grieved that they taught the people:1
I joy:1
whose name was Hirah:1
and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate:1
Go thou near:1
Despise not prophesyings:1
So Joshua smote all the country of the hills:1
They part my garments among them:1
When they couch in their dens:1
betrothed to an husband:1
yet cheweth not the cud:1
there is no spot in thee:1
when they wait for my soul:1
what desolations he hath made in the earth:1
he wept:6
their infants shall be dashed in pieces:1
where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear:1
but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it:1
that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance:1
for the wicked doth compass about the righteous:1
the ministers of the LORD:1
And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil:1
they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters:2
and the Jebusite in the mountains:1
have caused that even this man should not have died:1
and unto Makkedah:1
s son also:3
and tarried at Trogyllium:1
I know well that thou shalt surely be king:1
To them that are without law:1
a broken and a contrite heart:1
Enquire:4
ye everlasting doors:2
all my desire is before thee:1
But though I be rude in speech:1
Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting:1
What sawest thou:1
And they withstood Uzziah the king:1
And Adam gave names to all cattle:1
It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory:1
For I know that the LORD is great:1
And they set the priests in their divisions:1
there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth:1
Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain:1
And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites:1
And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus:1
therefore I am against thee:1
lest thou:29
at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints:1
when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned:1
which were sold unto the heathen:1
s chamber:21
Carry back the ark of God into the city:1
and the vessels of brass:2
by whom do your children cast them out:1
ye shall offer an oblation unto the LORD:1
that we may be dismayed:1
dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob:1
But Jesus answered and said:1
And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood:1
And Jacob loved Rachel:1
that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace:1
But whatsoever hath a blemish:1
of blind:1
And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished:1
even to such as are of a clean heart:1
Ye shall not steal:1
And David laid up these words in his heart:1
and he sat down:3
that they found a plain in the land of Shinar:1
And hast made us unto our God kings and priests:1
because the Jews sought to kill him:1
and heard a voice saying unto him:1
put it in their mouths:1
the Lord working with them:1
I will require it of him:1
when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the LORD:1
even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong:1
and Joshaviah:1
nor thine ox:1
more than those things which were spoken by Paul:1
for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt:1
And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil:4
but on a candlestick:2
And they shall comfort you:1
and mine heart walked after mine eyes:1
which they could not prove:1
lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit:1
and they took away the stones of Ramah:1
that were in the king:2
as ye have spoken:2
and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about:1
Told not I thee:1
but the men of Judah clave unto their king:1
which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt:1
when they arise:1
Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro:1
And your covenant with death shall be disannulled:1
Now we know that God heareth not sinners:1
That they may keep thee from the strange woman:1
And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life:1
and he poureth out of the same:1
and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers:1
unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:1
and returned to Samaria:1
And they that use this world:1
and laid them by heaps:1
and whither I go:2
And I will raise me up a faithful priest:1
He that is not with me is against me:2
And Boaz said unto her:1
until he have consumed thee from off the land:1
s dishonour:1
For the LORD is a great God:1
and it shall praise thee:1
The flakes of his flesh are joined together:1
The children of Bani:1
loving to slumber:1
but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures:1
he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon:1
Write the things which thou hast seen:1
for they are men wondered at:1
passover was nigh at hand:1
Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing:1
which thine eyes have seen:3
and I will destroy your high places:1
to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David:1
And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit:1
and seal the book:1
Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me:1
a thousand and seven hundred and threescore:1
did write:1
without driving them out hastily:1
And Ornan said unto David:1
and know my sheep:1
Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city:1
Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel:1
and cast me forth into the sea:1
The children of thy elect sister greet thee:1
that I should build him an house:1
and none shall make him afraid:2
that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice:1
And the channels of the sea appeared:1
who were dead in trespasses and sins:1
Sharon is like a wilderness:1
their drink offerings of blood will I not offer:1
For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles:1
the LORD which saidst unto me:1
that my soul may bless thee:2
he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces:1
and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan:1
For three transgressions of the children of Ammon:1
and walk in his ways:1
That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the matrix:1
who am also an elder:1
and Pamphylia:2
And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near:1
thee only:2
And all the men of Israel:3
Blessed be the LORD for evermore:1
So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day:1
and their children dance:1
nor the fierce lion passed by it:1
Pharaoh shall see them:1
to his own master he standeth or falleth:1
and I know it:1
Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers:1
Hold your peace:2
for they have turned their back unto me:1
and all the cattle of Egypt died:1
because ye have borne the shame of the heathen:1
and the house that is to be builded for the LORD must be exceeding magnifical:1
The same came therefore to Philip:1
and the defence shall be prepared:1
but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of Israel:1
It is one of the twelve:1
Cast not away therefore your confidence:1
But there was a strong tower within the city:1
The song of songs:1
I waited patiently for the LORD:1
spreadeth abroad her wings:1
And the two disciples heard him speak:1
and out of Asher:1
and righteous:23
wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon:1
and cities for his horsemen:1
the law:316
though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle:1
And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee:1
Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child:1
Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem:1
But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead:1
till all be fulfilled:2
but did evil before mine eyes:1
and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon:1
he also having a sharp sickle:1
Then shall it be for a man to burn:1
Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city:1
I create new heavens and a new earth:1
for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth:1
and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him:1
then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets:1
of thy son:15
they besought him instantly:1
This man is the great power of God:1
the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters:1
and turned his name to Jehoiakim:1
and he set his right foot upon the sea:1
s whelps are scattered abroad:1
And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven:1
that thou shalt keep this service in this month:1
Tarry until we come to you:1
father in law:26
as the heathen do:1
whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar:1
Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father:1
and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God:1
Then he suffered him:1
she hath given up the ghost:1
and ye shall not be judged:1
And there went from thence of the family of the Danites:1
and of Amalek:1
and they shall stand before them to minister unto them:1
s inkhorn by his side:2
let us go down:1
Thy servant is he:1
and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years:1
Teach us what we shall say unto him:1
his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom:1
and come again:6
and shalt lay it up within thy gates:1
Then came there unto him all his brethren:1
but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them:1
Helah and Naarah:1
If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment:1
so iniquity shall not be your ruin:1
and the ten thousand of breadth shall also the Levites:1
for God loveth a cheerful giver:1
the brooks of honey and butter:1
and returneth not thither:1
And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the LORD:1
or any evilfavouredness:1
as though he heard them not:1
As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa:1
that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved:1
s brother:163
for there he offered burnt offerings:2
and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof:1
of the Levites:56
I speak not of you all:1
if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more:1
and Hazarshual:1
And the LORD your God:1
Let destruction come upon him at unawares:1
For jealousy is the rage of a man:1
These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel:1
And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience:1
which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world:1
And next unto them repaired Zadok the son of Baana:1
And Jacob came to Shalem:1
and Hashum:1
And he brake them from off his arms like a thread:1
while he yet spake:6
and for his daughter:2
that thou fulfil it:1
And prayed unto him:1
for I fear him:1
and came into the parts of Dalmanutha:1
and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies:1
to destroy them from among the host:1
which is upon the bank of the river Arnon:1
and Solomon:11
because we had spoken unto the king:1
and the well is deep:1
so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land:1
And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people:1
the same soul will I destroy from among his people:1
and whosoever shall say to his brother:1
and he bare witness unto the truth:1
for they did not drive them out:1
For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants:1
that we say not:1
statutes:125
And over these three presidents:1
Go into the land:1
or peril:1
it shall be at an instant suddenly:1
I have given him the land of Egypt for his labour wherewith he served against it:1
Take up the ark of the covenant:2
therefore for thy name:1
my desire is:2
and how much more after my death:1
now advise:1
And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel:1
and the lesser light to rule the night:1
and mine anger in their destruction:1
and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it:1
and by my God have I leaped over a wall:1
let him likewise not return back:1
the priest of Midian:3
they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city:1
they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death:1
without spot:11
the sons of Elnaam:1
And say:40
and even for evermore:1
And the king said to Doeg:1
because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God:1
Jesus answered and said:34
As they were increased:1
Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land:1
and healed them all:1
and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem:1
nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them:1
For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death:1
and the other is not yet come:1
and speak unto them all that I command thee:1
trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now:1
which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor:1
The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the congregation of the LORD in their third generation:1
and let another take his office:1
the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia:1
the branches thereof are made white:1
But when the husbandmen saw him:1
and speak unto them:3
and fill the face of the world with fruit:1
having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly:1
even they both are abomination to the LORD:1
then shalt thou add three cities more for thee:1
that she may be healed:1
All these were of costly stones:1
And between the passages:1
as a good soldier of Jesus Christ:1
and sell the land into the hand of the wicked:1
and all that is made for them:1
and he repented him of the evil:1
And one goat for a sin offering:6
And Joseph:54
submit yourselves unto the elder:1
And to the genealogy of all their little ones:1
they kept the charge of the LORD:1
But their minds were blinded:1
and fought against all his enemies on every side:1
yet of myself I will not glory:1
from the end of the earth:3
for the children are come to the birth:1
they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots:1
to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge:1
The days are at hand:1
and I will require my flock at their hand:1
and made you go upright:1
they have taken root:1
and to the Amorite:1
my steps had well nigh slipped:1
Then said Pilate unto them:1
and chief of the fathers of Israel:1
they are wreathed:1
And one of the sons of Joiada:1
it shall not be lawful to impose toll:1
shall till the land for him:1
I shall be replenished:1
and destroy them quickly:1
for that is his portion:1
the oil:33
but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes:1
and thy burnt offering:1
And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage:1
Know ye not this parable:1
let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls:1
And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them:1
who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side:1
neither hast thou delivered thy people at all:1
s heart smote him after that he had numbered the people:1
all the length shall be five and twenty thousand:1
hath commanded them:1
thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm:1
where thou sowedst thy seed:1
And they lay themselves down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar:1
is his name:22
They give gifts to all whores:1
And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren:1
an evil beast hath devoured him:1
and told him all the truth:1
ye shall die in your sins:2
And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage:1
And Jesus called a little child unto him:1
For that ye ought to say:1
for thy servant heareth:2
Cursed be he that lieth with his mother in law:1
to pass for them through the fire:1
and begat Enos:1
If I should count them:1
The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:1
The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear:1
to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter:1
when ye have heaved from it the best of it:1
Surely God is in thee:1
which was a lawyer:1
it is a present sent unto my lord Esau:1
And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay:1
I gave ear to your reasons:1
And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah:1
O ye children:7
and thou seest not:1
and have followed thee:1
which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth:1
And it came to pass in the eleventh year:3
over against their brethren:2
and thou shalt say:3
and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again:1
the family of the Erites:1
and the high arm shall be broken:1
They say unto the blind man again:1
against my shepherd:1
they believed not his word:1
and all knees shall be weak as water:2
but come not near any man upon whom is the mark:1
and Paul:5
or that which was delivered him to keep:1
Ye shall not round the corners of your heads:1
and to Aaron:3
In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found:1
and the brass for things of brass:1
and to provoke him to speak of many things:1
and their seed:3
Therefore we are always confident:1
and called Leshem:1
and publish in Migdol:1
that Esther put on her royal apparel:1
Thou art good:1
There are men come out of Samaria:1
and lie with her:4
Sing unto God:2
Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit:1
and should have been killed of them:1
and shall take thy fair jewels:1
and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day:1
and Admah:1
I live for ever:1
Open the mouth of the cave:1
and grew:4
Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes:1
they pierced my hands and my feet:1
whereof I Paul am made a minister:1
And he spake three thousand proverbs:1
stirred up all the people:1
sensual:2
and I will cause you to dwell in this place:1
all mine enemies have heard of my trouble:1
strong drink is raging:1
nor uncircumcised in flesh:1
And Saul knew David:1
from their mouth:4
most noble Festus:1
For David:5
at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller:1
but the redeemed shall walk there:1
And they come to Jesus:1
as ye do:6
and ground it very small:1
and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families:1
that he may do as Esther hath said:1
Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations:1
neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed:1
whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by:1
His glory covered the heavens:1
But at the last Daniel came in before me:1
Giving thanks unto the Father:1
but I find not:1
and his four sons with him hid themselves:1
that pass over the sea:1
By the blast of God they perish:1
and did as the LORD had said unto him:1
he hath abhorred his sanctuary:1
and that thou hast turned their heart back again:1
but to minister:2
which hath departed from me:1
which are four:1
Now king David was old and stricken in years:1
which he had for himself alone:1
and weep:11
For which hope:1
and I retained no strength:1
for two:6
and disinherit them:1
saith the LORD thy Redeemer:1
Now when they were going:1
so shall your seed and your name remain:1
And he brought them before the king of Moab:1
to the end that he should multiply horses:1
and walk not in my judgments:1
I was there:1
all ye the seed of Israel:1
Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren:1
and sacrifice to the LORD our God:1
again:2196
whose name was Rizpah:1
and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock:1
that the truth of the gospel might continue with you:1
Which was the son of Jose:1
Will the Lord cast off for ever:1
And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD:1
for my soul is wearied because of murderers:1
And they went every one straight forward:1
go down with me:2
the daughters of Zelophehad:5
and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben:1
For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity:1
From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it:1
behold a man full of leprosy:1
and because thou art polluted with their idols:1
My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there:1
and was sufficed:1
his eye was not dim:1
clothed with a cloud:1
and upon the inhabitants of the same:1
for whereas we have offended against the LORD already:1
which ye have of God:1
Ever learning:1
and baldness upon all their heads:1
And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse:1
and Shamed:1
Each charger of silver weighing an hundred and thirty shekels:1
Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father:1
within were fears:1
and also half the people of Israel:1
and blessed the people:2
It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this:1
a reproach:25
And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about:1
and the people murmured against Moses:1
And when they saw him:3
be graffed into their own olive tree:1
and we smote him:2
And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley:1
Shew us thy mercy:1
and told it his brethren:1
and he will draw nigh to you:1
neither missed we any thing:1
and in your spirit:1
and many believed in the Lord:1
which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned:1
and from the desert unto the river:1
it is a burnt offering unto the LORD:1
and the Philistines went to their own place:1
And we took their land:1
and ye shall sow your seed in vain:1
what should come to pass hereafter:1
The workman melteth a graven image:1
So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver:1
as the LORD sware unto them:1
there make ready:2
And all Israel shall mourn for him:1
and bring upon themselves swift destruction:1
And the frogs shall depart from thee:1
and seeth the place of stones:1
If ye will be as we be:1
the aged with him that is full of days:1
Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue:1
And the unclean spirits went out:1
thou art the King of Israel:1
and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister:1
and he was intreated of them:1
the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously:1
but the things that be of men:1
God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you:1
after they came forth out of Egypt:1
He shall come as an eagle against the house of the LORD:1
And when he would have put him to death:1
And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab:1
nor of darkness:1
they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath:1
and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away:1
whereof he hath given assurance unto all men:1
which for a while believe:1
And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge:1
but he that shall endure unto the end:1
and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians:1
because he had fought against Hadadezer:1
God is greater than our heart:1
a young bullock for a sin offering:2
and their stink shall come up out of their carcases:1
and out of the land of Judah:1
in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee:6
nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD:1
For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness:1
and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom:1
For it was said to me by the word of the LORD:1
and the clouds drop down the dew:1
he giveth meat in abundance:1
he came unto the sea of Galilee:1
I will cast thee from off the face of the earth:1
and touched him:4
This is the first resurrection:1
and all the cities that he built:1
all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths:1
bless ye the LORD:1
then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father:1
to give to their brethren by courses:1
And ye have this day rejected your God:1
and they smote him:4
A violent man enticeth his neighbour:1
and Uel:1
and do all my commandments:1
by the causeway of the going up:1
so Tibni died:1
We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not:1
the children of Gahar:2
